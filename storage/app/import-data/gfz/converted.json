        "description": "This dataset comprises 47 fluid samples from 11 geothermal sites (Germany, Austria, Iceland, Turkey, Netherlands, Belgium, French West Indies). The samples were collected within the REFLECT project (Redefining geothermal properties at extreme conditions to optimize future geothermal energy extraction). The focus with these analyses were on the organic compound composition of the fluids, since they are rarely included in the analyses of fluids taken from geothermal power plants. Understanding the organic compound composition of geothermal fluids might help to better understand chemical reactions within the fluids and might help to mitigate problems that arise with the operation of a geothermal power plant such as mineral precipitation (scaling) and corrosion of the casing and pipes.",

        "description": "A compilation of 29,574 published radiometric dates for metamorphic rocks from the South American Andes and adjacent parts of South America have been tabulated for access by researchers via GEOROC Expert Datasets. The compilation exists as a spreadsheet for access via MS Excel, Google Sheets, and other spreadsheet applications. Initial igneous compilations were utilized in two publications by the author, Pilger (1981, 1984). The compilations have been added to in subsequent years with the metamorphic and sedimentary compilations separated in the last few years. Locations in latitude and longitude are largely taken from the original source, if provided, with UTM locations maintained and converted; in some cases, sample locations were digitized from electronic maps if coordinates were otherwise not available. Analytical results are not included to prevent the files from becoming too large. The existing compilation incorporates compilations by other workers in smaller regions of the Andes. References to original and compilation sources are included. \n \nWhile I am updating reconstructions of the South American and Nazca\/Farallon plates, incorporating recent studies in the three oceans, for comparison with the igneous dates for the past 80 m. y., it is hoped that the spreadsheets will be of value to other workers. \n \nReliability: In most cases the data have been copy\/pasted from published or appendix tables. In a few cases, the location has been digitized from published maps; the (equatorial equidistant) maps were copied into Google Earth and positioned according to indicated coordinates, with locations digitized and copied\/pasted into the spreadsheet. (It is possible that published maps are conventional Mercator-based, even if not so identified, rather than either equatorial equidistant or Universal Transverse Mercator; this can be a source of error in location. For UTMs, the errors should be minor.) Duplicates are largely recognized by equivalent IDs, dates, and uncertainties.

In 2019, two strong paroxysms on July 3rd and August 28th, ended a more than a decade long period of regular strombolian activity.

The network, which covered the entire southern Aegean Sea from the Peloponnesus region in the west to western Turkey in the east, was designed to study seismicity as well as the distribution of the elastic and anelastic material properties in the Hellenic subduction zone to better understand its complex geotectonic setting and evolution. The network encompassed 45 G\u00fcralp 60-second seismometers, four Streckeisen STS-2 seismometers, and seven 1-Hertz Mark seismometers at land sites. The seismometers were supplemented by 22 ocean bottom seismographs equipped with G\u00fcralp 60- second seismometers and broadband hydrophones. In addition, the network was designed to incorporate the seven permanent broadband seismographs of the GeoForschungsNetz (GEOFON) network and one Mediterranean Very Broadband Seismographic Network (MedNet) station.

Cape Verde is located in the interior of a slow-moving oceanic plate, away from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and is associated with one of the world\u2019s largest swell. Some swells are believed to be caused by mantle plumes that rise from deep in the mantle to interact with the base of the lithosphere, while others are considered to be originated by the stress state of the lithospheric plates themselves. As part of a combined study of seismic, gravimetric, magnetic and geochemical observations in order to get a clearer picture of what is happening underneath Cape Verde we performed a first dense seismological VBB network deployment on several Cape Verde islands in 2007 and 2008. This presented a unique opportunity to assemble an important archive of high-quality seismic waveforms, recorded on oceanic volcanic islands.

        "description": "At valley glaciers, rockwall erosion supplies debris to glacier surfaces. Once deposited on the ice, rockwall debris is passively entrained and becomes part of the glacial system, e.g., forming medial moraines as downglacier transport continues. Where debris occurs supraglacial, it modifies ice ablation and, thus, changes in rockwall erosion and debris supply rates modify glacial debris cover and mass balance and may affect glacier retreat in response to climate change. Yet, estimates on rockwall erosion rates close to glacier surfaces are few and quantifying spatiotemporal supply patterns is not trivial. \n \nThis data publication is supplementary to the study on rockwall erosion rates at five Swiss valley glaciers around Pigne d\u2019Arolla, by Wetterauer &amp; Scherler (2023). We temporally and spatially assess rockwall erosion by measuring in situ-produced cosmogenic 10Be concentrations ('[10Be]measured') in medial moraine debris, which we systematically sampled along downglacier-profiles, and by comparing records from various medial moraines, which are supplied by rockwalls differing in exposure and morphology. However, as '[10Be]measured' within supraglacial debris is the sum of '[10Be]rockwall', accumulated during rockwall erosion, and '[10Be]transport', accumulated during post-depositional downglacier transport, medial moraine '[10Be]measured' should be corrected for '[10Be]transport'. If glacier velocities through time are known, '[10Be]transport' can be estimated by downglacier debris trajectory modelling. Providing our 10Be dataset and ~40-year records of glacier surface velocities from four of the five valley glaciers (Glacier du Brenay, Glacier de Cheilon, Glacier de Pi\u00e8ce, Glacier de Tsijiore Nouve) is the main objective of this data publication.

        "description": "This data publication is supplementary to the study on headwall erosion rates at Glacier d'Otemma in Switzerland, by Wetterauer et al. (2022). Debris on glacier surfaces stems from steep bedrock hillslopes that tower above the ice, so-called headwalls. Recently, rock walls in high-alpine glacial environments experience increased destabilization due to climate warming. Since supraglacial debris alters the melt behaviour of the ice underneath, increased headwall erosion and debris delivery to glacier surfaces will modify glacial mass balances. Therefore, we expect that the response of glaciers to climate change is likely linked to how headwall erosion responds to climate change. As headwall debris is deposited on the ice surface of valley glaciers it is passively transported downglacier, both supra- and englacially. Where two glaciers join, debris along their margins is merged to form medial moraines. Since medial moraine debris tends to be older downglacier, systematic downglacier-sampling of medial moraine debris and the measurement of in situ-produced cosmogenic 10Be concentrations ([10Be]) hold the potential to assess long-term (&gt;10^2-10^4 yrs) headwall erosion rates through time. However, to obtain the cosmogenic signals of headwall erosion, [10Be] within supraglacial debris need to be corrected for glacial transport time, as cosmogenic nuclides continue to accumulate during exposure and transport. This additional 10Be accumulation during debris transport can be accounted for by simple downglacier debris trajectory modelling. Providing our 10Be dataset together with detailed information on our 1-D modelling approach is the main objective of this data publication. The data is presented as one single xlsx-file with three different tables. A detailed description of the sample processing and the debris trajectory model are provided in the data description file of this data publication.

        "description": "The dataset presented here encompasses the results of the geochemical analyses of water and recent carbonate samples collected in the El Peinado basin located in the Southern Puna Plateau in Catamarca, Argentina. This system formed by the hypersaline lake Laguna del Peinado, numerous hydrothermal springs, and the small hypersaline lake Laguna Turquesa, provides a natural laboratory to study carbonate formation and the mechanisms that control the incorporation of various elements and isotopes into their structure under a broad range of geochemical conditions. Geochemical analyses include data on the physicochemical parameters, elemental, and isotopic (\u03b418O, \u03b42H, \u03b411B) composition of the waters, and data on the elemental and isotopic (\u03b418O, \u03b413C, \u03b411B) composition of the carbonates. These data allowed us to calculate element partition coefficients and isotopic fractionation between coupled water-carbonate samples from this natural setting, which are also included here. This dataset also includes the results of water modelling using the software PHREEQC, which contains data on the chemical speciation of carbon and boron, the species contributing to total alkalinity, and mineral saturation indices. This information is useful for all those dealing with geochemistry of hypersaline lakes, geochemistry of continental carbonates, as well as paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic studies using lake carbonates as archives.

        "description": "This dataset provides friction data from drained ring-shear tests on a wet (water saturated) silica powder-glass beads-PVC powder mixture (40:40:20 wt.%) \u201cCM2\u201d, used in analogue modelling of tectonic and erosion processes as a rock analogue for the earth\u2019s upper crust (e.g. Conrad et al., 2023, Reitano et al., 2020, 2022. 2023). According to our analysis the materials show a Mohr-Coulomb behaviour characterized by a linear failure envelope. Peak, dynamic and reactivation friction coefficients of CM2 are \u00b5P = 0.66, \u00b5D = 0.58, and \u00b5R = 0.61, respectively. Cohesion of the material ranges between 60-230 Pa. The tested bulk material CM2 consists of a mixture of 40 wt. % silica powder, 40 wt.% glass beads and 20 wt.% PVC powder which has been saturated with water (Table 1). Specification of silica powder is \u201cVentilated Quartz VR16\u201d (https:\/\/www.valligranulati.it\/products-granules-quartz-marble-sands-premixed\/sheet-m\/ventilated-quartz) by the company Valli Granulati S.r.l. (Italy). Ventilated quartz is obtained by micronisation of quartz sands with a high content of SiO2 (around 96%), and used e.g. in paints and abrasives. It should be handled with care to omit generation of dust and a half mask (filter class FFA1P2 RD) should be worn because it can harm the human respiratory tract with the potential of causing silicosis. Glass beads used here have a size (diameter) of 700-110 \u00b5m and their individual properties are described in detail Pohlenz et al. (2020). The commercial name for the PVC powder is \u201cPVC K.57 Inovyn 257RF\u201d by the company TPV Compound (Italy). PVC powder is mainly used for cleaning industrial structures (as abrasives) or for the production of PVC tubing, plastic sheets etc. The composition of this PVC powder is the same of the common Polyvinyl chloride. According to the regulation CE n.1272\/2008 (CLP), this type of PVC powder is classified as not dangerous for the supply, also thanks to its low value of density and round shape.",

        "description": "This data publication contains (i) a slab model of the Cascadia subduction zone, derived from receiver functions, parameterized as depth to the three interfaces: t (top), c (central) and m (Moho), in NetCDF format; (ii) the station measurements of all parameters in the model in tabular and Raysum model file format; (iii) the raw receiver functions in SAC format; and (iv) auxiliary scripts for loading and plotting the data. A total of 45,601 individual receiver functions recorded at 298 seismic stations distributed across the Cascadia forearc contributed to the slab model. For each station, 100 s recordings symmetric about the P -wave arrival (i.e. 50 s noise and 50 s signal) of earthquakes with magnitudes between 5.5 and 8, in the distance range between 30 and 100 degree, were downloaded from the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) data center, the Northern California Earthquake Data Center (NCEDC), and the Natural Resources Canada Data Center (NRCAN). After quality control, radial and transverse receiver functions were computed through frequency-domain simultaneous deconvolution, with an optimal damping factor found through generalized cross validation. The continental forearc and subducting slab were parameterized as three layers over a mantle half-space, with the subduction stratigraphy bounding interfaces labeled as t (top), c (central) and m (Moho). Synthetic receiver functions were calculated through ray-theoretical modeling of plane-wave scattering at the model interfaces. The thickness, S -wave velocity (VS) and P - to S -wave velocity ratio (VP\/VS) of each layer, as well as the common strike and dip of the bottom two layers and the top of the half space (in total 11 parameters) were optimized simultaneously through a simulated annealing global parameter search scheme. The misfit was defined as the anti-correlation (1 minus the cross-correlation coefficient) between the observed and predicted receiver functions, bandpass filtered between 2 and 20 s period duration. In total, 171, 143 and 137 quality A nodes were determined to constrain the t, c and m interfaces, respectively. At the trench, 105 nodes at 3 km below the local bathymetry were inserted to constrain the t and c interfaces, and at 6.5 km deeper to constrain the m interface, representing typical sediment and igneous crustal thicknesses. A spline surface was fitted to these nodes to yield margin-wide depth models. The spline coefficients were found using singular value decomposition, with the nominal depth uncertainties supplied as weights. The solution was damped by retaining the 116, 117, and 116 largest singular values for the t, c and m interfaces, respectively, based on analysis of L-curves and the Akaike information criterion.

        "title": "Black Forest Observatory Data",
        "description": "The Black Forest Observatory Data collection compiles digital data recorded at Black Forest Observatory (BFO) in Germany and provided through several international data centers. BFO aims to observe the entire geodynamic spectrum. It strives to ensure continuous, uninterrupted operation and is internationally recognized for high signal quality and sensitivity. Observed quantities cover three components of acceleration (including ground motion, gravity and tilt), strain, magnetic field, and others (see description of instruments below). The set of instruments and data recorders in operation provides a significant level of redundancy, which allows to distinguish natural phenomena from possible instrumental artefacts. The Black Forest Observatory (BFO) is a joint research facility of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and the University of Stuttgart (Duffner et al., 2018; Gottsch\u00e4mmer et al. 2014). Since 1971 it is operated in cooperation of the geophysical and geodetic institutes of both universities (Z\u00fcrn, 2014). BFO is staffed with two scientists and one technician. Main activities of the observatory fall into four categories, which are (1) observation and publication of a continuously recorded multi-parameter geodynamic data set, (2) research, (3) hosting of guest-experiments, and (4) teaching. The location of the observatory (48.3301 \u00b0N, 8.3296 \u00b0E) in the middle of the Black Forest was carefully selected at large distances to potential anthropogenic sources of noise. The instruments are deployed in a former silver mine in competent granite rock at a depth of up to 170 m below the surface and at up to 700 m distance from the entrance of the mine. This provides a thermally very stable environment. Two air-locks provide additional protection against air-pressure variations and ensure thermal stability. Because of these favorable conditions and the excellent high precision instruments operated at BFO the observatory is internationally well known as one of the most sensitive sites for long period observations, providing international standards for the scientific community, e.g. for recordings of Earth's free oscillations. The Black Forest Observatory operates broad-band seismometers (STS-1 and STS-2), gravimeters (superconducting gravimeter SG056, LaCoste Romberg earth-tide gravimeter ET-19), tiltmeters (Askania borehole tiltmeter, Horsfall fluid tiltmeter), an array of three invar-wire strainmeters, magnetometers (a scalar GSM-90 Overhauser magnetometer and a three component Rasmussen fluxgate magnetometers) and a permanent GPS-station. These are supplemented by regularly repeated magnetic base-line measurements and observations of absolute gravity as well as the recording of several environmental parameters (air-pressure, infrasound, humidity, wind speed, precipitation and temperature). Some of the latter are used to correct geodynamic recordings for remaining disturbances. The data are published in near-real-time through international data centers (IRIS DMC at Seattle, SZO at the BGR in Hannover, INTERMAGNET, GNSS Data Center at the BKG in Frankfurt, IGETS Database at GFZ Potsdam). Data are made available free of charge to scientific projects as well as to the general public with attribution as defined in the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence (CC BY 4.0). An extended review of research at BFO is given by Z\u00fcrn (2014) and Duffner et al. (2018, in German). Both provide references to published BFO research.",

It consists predominantly of fine- to coarse-grained, composi-tionally immature to mature, quartzose sandstones up to 3.6 km thick, with significant units of con-glomerates and siltstones and minor volcanic rocks and ferruginous sediments. The quartz-dominated Moodies sandstones mark long-term, large-scale access of surface systems to crust-stabilizing, high-level granitoid igneous rocks. 47 petrographic thin sections of sandstones from these sandstone units were analyzed for 2D grain size analyses. At least 500 measurements of long axes per thin were taken, using a Keyence VHX-6000 digital microscope. Samples which show significant grain boundary migration and subgrain rotation were excluded from this analysis (Passchier and Trouw, 2005).

Geophone stations are buried at shallow depths while two of the broadband seismometers are installed in-house at basement level.

During heating, the relative amount of different volatile species (H2O, CO2, SO2, HCl, and H2S, which are extracted from mass-to-charge ratios of 18, 44, 64, 36, and 34, respectively) were recorded by the gas mass spectrometer. Natural samples collected for the analysis were bulk ash material or correspond to a given ash fraction. Particles were unwashed and dried at 40\u00b0C before analysis. We compared the signals for natural samples with (i) a mixture of salt-free dense glassy particles, white and dark pumice (HT10), (ii) pure halite, anhydrite, gypsum, calcite and pyrit, (iii) mix between pure magmatic particles (HT10) from (i) and manually added components from (iii).",

We use continuous seismic records of a small network at the S\u00e4var River in northern Sweden to interpret processes and quantify water and sediment fluxes. We apply a seismic inversion approach to determine seasonal differences in hydraulics and bedload sediment transport under ice-covered vs. open-channel flow conditions and provide a first-order estimation of sediment flux in that Fennoscandian river. Analysis of seismic signals of ice-cracking support our visual interpretation of ice break-up timing and the main ice break-up mechanism as thermal rather than mechanical.

        "description": "This dataset was used to analyse the link between chemical weathering and erosion rates across the southern tip of Taiwan. The weathering of silicate minerals is a key component of Earth\u2019s long-term carbon cycle, and it stabilises Earth\u2019s climate by sequestering carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere \u2013 thereby balancing CO2-emissions from the mantle. Conversely, the weathering of accessory carbonate and sulphides acts as a CO2 source. Chemical weathering is fundamentally dependent on the exposure of fresh minerals by erosion. With these data we investigated the link between the exposure of rocks by erosion and the chemical weathering of silicates, carbonates, and sulphides across a landscape with a significant erosion-rate gradient and comparatively little variation in runoff and lithology. This dataset includes new major element chemistry and water isotopes of river waters collected from across the southern tip of Taiwan as well as associated topographic and lithologic data (tab 1 in the excel table). Moreover, the data include a compilation of published 10Be-derived erosion rates from a subset of the sampled rivers (tab 2 in the excel file) and available major element chemistry from hotsprings in the region (tab 3 in the excel file). Using a mixing model, we derived the cation contributions from silicate and carbonate weathering as well as from hotspring and cyclic sources. Further, we estimated the erosion rates for each sample from the compiled 10Be data and the steepness of river channels, and we estimated saturation and pH in the weathering zone. For more information please refer to the associated data description file and especially to Bufe et al. (2021).",

        "description": "Trace element (TE) analysis of pyrite via LA-ICP-MS can produce large, paragenetically-constrained datasets, which can be used to reconstruct the conditions of pyrite formation in complex mineral systems. The Carpentaria province in northern Australia is host to some of the world\u2019s highest value Zn-Pb (+Ag, Cu) deposits. The genesis of many of these deposits in the southern part of the province is controversial due to tectonic overprinting, with competing models of single- vs. multi-stage ore formation. In this study, LA-ICP-MS analysis of pyrite from the George Fisher Zn-Pb-Ag deposit and correlative unmineralized host rocks has been combined with paragenetic and whole rock lithogeochemical data. Paragenetically constrained pyrite TE data were then evaluated in the context of single- vs. multi-stage ore formation models and compared with recent data from undeformed clastic-dominated (CD-type) deposits of the northern Carpentaria province. Pre-ore diagenetic pyrite is compositionally similar to other Proterozoic diagenetic pyrite, with some evidence of minor hydrothermal anomalism that could help define distal alteration, but requires further analysis. Pyrite from the different ore stages is compositionally distinct, consistent with a multi-stage system. Ore stage 1 pyrite has high concentrations of Cu, Zn, As, Ag, Sb, Tl, and Pb as well as high Co\/Ni ratios, whereas ore stage 2 pyrite contains Ni and Co, and ore stage 3 pyrite is dominated by Co with lesser concentrations of Ni and Cu. Ore stage 1 pyrite has a similar composition to hydrothermal pyrite in the undeformed northern Carpentaria CD-type deposits and likely formed syn-diagenesis. Ore stage 2 was syn-deformation, and resulted in replacement and recrystallization of pre-existing pyrite that also resulted in the expulsion of incompatible TEs. Ore stage 3 formed via a later Cu mineralizing event that resulted in a new geochemically distinct generation of Co-rich pyrite. This study demonstrates the value of pargenetically-constrained pyrite TE data for refining genetic models in complex sediment hosted mineral systems. This data publication includes pyrite trace element compositions (in ppm) of 28 samples from the un-mineralized Urquhart Shale Formation and from the George Fisher deposit. Access to drill cores was granted by Mount Isa Mines (MIM) George Fisher operation and Mount Isa Mines Resource Development.",

        "description": "In 2020 and 2021 the STIMTEC-X hydraulic stimulation experiment was performed at ca.~130 m below surface at the Reiche Zeche underground research laboratory in Freiberg, Saxony\/Germany. The project temporally followed the STIMTEC experiment at the same site and aimed at understanding the stress heterogeneity of the anisotropic and metamorphic gneiss rock mass. The STIMTEC-X experiment applied the hydraulic stimulation technique in several boreholes at the mine-scale. Complementary to the stimulations, there were active seismic ultrasonic transmission data acquired before the stimulations. We use a seismic monitoring network consisting of six single-component acoustic emission (AE) sensors (sensitivity 1-60 kHz), six hydrophone-like AE sensors (sensitivity 1-40 kHz) and four to twelve single-component Wilcoxon accelerometers (sensitivity 50 Hz-25 kHz). The AE sensors and remained stationary in sub-horizontal and upwards reaching boreholes, the accelerometers were mostly installed along the tunnel walls with one accelerometer in a shallow borehole in each tunnel, and the hydrophone-like AE sensors were installed in the down-going water filled boreholes, but repositioned for each measurement campaign (Figure 1). This data set of 120 active ultrasonic transmission (UT) measurements is supplementary to Boese et al. (2022, in review), which introduces some of the active measurement campaigns of the STIMTEC-X experiment in detail. The whole data set togetter with the \u201cUltrasonic transmission measurements from six boreholes from the STIMTEC experiment, Reiche Zeche Mine, Freiberg (Saxony, Germany)\u201d [https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5880\/GFZ.4.2.2021.002] was used to evaluate performance measures such as sensitivity and frequency bandwith, coupling, placement and polarity of the hydrophone-like AE sensor compared to AE sensors. The active seismic data provided here are from seven boreholes (BH01, BH05, BH06, BH10, BH14, BH18, BH19) as shown in Figure 1. There are nine tables provided as metadata of which seven contain the STIMTEC-X sensor coordinates for each measurement campaign, the event information of all the 120 UT measurements and the UT picks. The UT measurements were recorded with a sampling rate of 1 MHz and results from an automatic stack of 1024 UT pulses generated by the ultrasonic transmitter and recorded by the STIMTEC-X sensors. The UT measurements are saved in binary file format (fsf file format). Fsf-files can be processed with FOCI software: https:\/\/www.induced.pl\/software\/foci. Each fsf file contains 32768 samples, which corresponds to 0.032768 seconds. All UT event files were manual inspected and phase arrivals identified. These are stored in the fsf-file header as well as in the table STIMTECX_UT_picks.csv.",

However, in the light of recently published higher resolution region specific 3D geophysical models, that conform to secondary data measurements, the generation of a more up to date revision of the thermal field and long term lithospheric yield strength is made possible, in order to shed light on open questions of the state of the orogen.

        "description": "The Chilean Coastal Cordillera features a spectacular climate and vegetation gradient, ranging from arid and unvegetated areas in the north to humid and forested areas in the south. The DFG Priority Program \"EarthShape\" (Earth Surface Shaping by Biota) uses this natural gradient to investigate how climate and biological processes shape the Earth's surface. We explored the critical zone, the Earth's uppermost layer, in four key sites located in desert, semidesert, mediterranean, and temperate climate zones of the Coastal Cordillera, with the focus on weathering of granitic rock. Here, we present first results from four ~2m-deep regolith profiles to document: (1) architecture of weathering zone; (2) degree and rate of rock weathering, thus the release of mineral-derived nutrients to the terrestrial ecosystems; (3) denudation rates; and (4) microbial abundances of bacteria and archaea in the saprolite.\n      From north to south, denudation rates from cosmogenic nuclides are ~10 t km-2 yr-1 at the arid Pan de Az\u00facar site, ~20\u202ft km-2 yr-1 at the semi-arid site of Santa Gracia, ~60 t km-2 yr-1 at the mediterranean climate site of La Campana, and ~30 t km-2 yr-1 at the humid site of Nahuelbuta. A and B horizons increase in thickness and elemental depletion or enrichment increases from north (~26\u202f\u00b0S) to south (~38\u202f\u00b0S) in these horizons. Differences in the degree of chemical weathering, quantified by the chemical depletion fraction (CDF), are significant only between the arid and sparsely vegetated site and the other three sites. Differences in the CDF between the sites, and elemental depletion within the sites are sometimes smaller than the variations induced by the bedrock heterogeneity. Microbial abundances (bacteria and archaea) in saprolite substantially increase from the arid to the semi-arid sites.\n      With this study, we provide a comprehensive dataset characterizing the Critical Zone geochemistry in the Chilean Coastal Cordillera. This dataset confirms climatic controls on weathering and denudation rates and provides prerequisites to quantify the role of biota in future studies. The data are supplementary material to Oeser et al. (2018).\n      All samples are assigned with International Geo Sample Numbers (IGSN), a globally unique and persistent Identifier for physical samples.

The great bulk of measured grains display variably declined chondrite-normalized LREE patterns virtually free of anomalies indicative for significant fluid-induced overprinting. We have rocks characterized by largely unzoned, chemically homogeneous grains. There are as well rocks containing nicely patchy-zoned grains showing a wide range in composition, in particular regarding the Th\/LREE proportions. Here, maximum measured Th concentration amounted to 33 wt% ThO2. Incorporation of Th into the crystal structure is almost exclusively governed by the huttonite substitution reaction, i.e., Th^4+ + Si^4+ = REE^3+ + P^5+, as characteristic for this chemical type of granites (F\u00f6rster 1998). The suite of rocks also included samples containing small-sized inclusions of Th-poor monazite in apatite, which formed in response to metamorphic, fluid-aided dissolution-reprecipitation processes (Harlov and F\u00f6rster 2003, Harlov et al. 2005). Finally, we have a quartz monzonite containing Th-poor monazite in apatite together with matrix monazite of normal Th concentration, the origin if which is not yet fully resolved (cf. Foerster-2018-004_monazite-alberta-BSE images.pdf. presenting back-scattered electron images of monazite grains). In brief, the data set provides information on several aspects of formation and alteration of monazite in non-metamorphic and metamorphic granite.\n      The data set published here contains the complete pile of data acquired for monazite-(Ce) and back-scattered electron (BSE) images of many of the probed grains. Chemical data are provided as Excel and machine-readable .csv files, which contain the information listed in Table 1 of the data description file. Column headers in red (only in the Excel version) indicate that the data and information provided in these columns is from Walsh (2013). \u201c0.00\u201d means that the concentrations of the respective elements were measured, but were below their limits of detection. Blank boxes in oxide concentrations columns indicate that the respective elements were not sought. The collection of BSE images is presented as pdf.file.

        "description": "IPOC Creep is an array of 11 creepmeters installed along 4 active segments oft eh Atacama Fault Zone in Northern Chile. Installation of instruments started in 2008 within the framework of the Integrated Plate-boundary Observatory Chile (IPOC) and was completed in 2011. All installations are designed by the authors and follow a general concept, but are adapted to each site specifically. All the installed instruments use solid 12 mm thick invar rods as length standards, which are firmly attached to a concrete foundation in the hanging wall of the fault and pass through a PVC pipe to the footwall side of the fault where it is fixed to another concrete foundation. The creepmeters are buried at a depth of 30 - 70 cm, in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We use a LVDT (linear variable differential transformer) with a range of 50 mm to monitor the relative displacement of the free end of the rod relative to the fixation point. Displacement is measured as voltage change and stored on a data logger with a sampling rate of 1\/min (2008-2011 and 2\/min (since 2011). Temperature at the rod is continuously measured with the same sampling rate to correct for thermal expansion and contraction of the length standard. The length of the instrument is dependent on the geometry at each site and ranges between 2 and 9 m. More specific information on each site can be found on http:\/\/www.ipoc-network.org\/index.php\/observatory\/creepmeter.html . \n      \nThe Data is stored as time series since the initial start of operation of each creepmeter until July 2016.

By normalizing to the reference signal it is possible to  correct for these voltage changes.\n      \n      4th column CreepSensor[V]The measured voltage of the CreepSensor is linearly proportional to the actual displacement. It can be converted to micrometers as follows: Displacement(\u00b5m) = (CreepSensor(t2)[V] - CreepSensor(t1)[V]) * 10000.",

        "description": "This data-set contains provenance detrital data from the glacimarine sequence of Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 270. The 270 site was cored on a flank of the Central High in the central Ross Sea and recovered a thick Oligocene to lower Miocene glacimarine sequence, overlain by ~20 m of Pliocene to Recent strata. This site provides important temporal constraints on regional stratigraphy and insights into late Oligocene to early Miocene ice sheet dynamics. We analyzed eight detrital samples of glaciomarine sediments distributed along the core and two from the basement rocks recovered during coring, by using an integrated single-grain provenance approach. This multi-proxy provenance study employs conventional U-Pb detrital zircon dating integrated with apatite U-Pb and fission-track dating and trace element analysis of detrital apatite and clast petrology. The data-set suggests a general evolution from local erosion due to small ice caps to far-travelled glacial detritus responding to the continuous sea floor subsidence. The detrital age spectra of a late Oligocene diamicitite is consistent with far travelled grains from southern West Antarctica (WA), suggesting an expansion of the WA ice sheet that should be the oldest and first evidence of ice sheet growth on the WA.",

        "description": "This data publication includes detrital remanent magnetisation data of glacial sediments from the Arkhangelsky Ridge in the SE Black Sea. In order to test the acquisition of a detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) in glacial Black Sea sediments material from ca. 800 ml of diluted mud with a density of 1.3 gcm-3 was successively redeposited into seven plastic boxes under controlled magnetic field conditions. A two-component coil system was used to adjust the magnetic field in horizontal (H, equal to magnetic NS) and vertical (V) direction. Total field strength for each experiment with seven samples was varied between 1.72 and 114.21 \u00b5T (1st column of data sheet), mostly opposite to the ambient field in the laboratory. Compaction (partial drying) of the diluted mud was accomplished by evaporation of a fraction of the pore water. Sample boxes were sited on a wooden platform. Vibration of the platform, excited by an old computer fan with an imbalance hanging below the platform, was intended both to promote alignment of magnetic particles parallel to the field set by the coils and to force settling of the sediments during partial drying. The majority of the samples were treated this way, entry \u2018vibr.\u2019 in column \u2018action\u2019 of data sheet. A smaller portion of the samples were created on \u2018still\u2019 platform, that is, without vibration. Samples were treated the following way: Measurements of low-field magnetic susceptibility (k-bulk) were performed with an AGICO MFK-1S susceptibility meter. Measurements of the detritral remanent magnetization (DRM) and of the anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) were performed with a 2G 755 SRM long-core cryogenic magnetometer. The ARM was imparted with a 2G660 single-axis alternating field (AF) demagnetizer using 100 mT alternating field and 50 \u00b5T static field. After ARM measurements, samples produced on vibrating platform also were imparted a \u2018strong\u2019 ARM (sARM) using 100 mT alternating field and 150 \u00b5T static field. DRM and (s)ARM both were stepwise demagnetized with the in-line 3-axes AF demagnetizer of the cryogenic magnetometer, applying steps of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 65, 80, 100 mT AF peak amplitude. Iso-thermal remanent magnetizations (IRM) were imparted with a 2G 660 pulse magnetizer using 1500 mT for producing a saturation magnetization and -200 mT for remagnetization of the low-coercive fraction. Measurements were performed with a Molyneux spinner magnetometer. The data are provided as ASCII table and are described in Nowaczyk et al. (2020) and the associated data description file.",

We investigated a drillcore profile through the UG2 layer affected by IRUP intrusions at Tha-ba mine, NW Bushveld. The work involved quantitative assessment of the ore mineralogy from mineral liberation analysis (MLA), chemical analyses of the main silicate and oxide minerals by elec-tron microprobe (EPMA) and micro-X-ray fluorescence (micro-XRF) element maps of the UG2-IRUP contacts. The data reveal features of UG2-IRUP interaction at different scales. The micro-XRF study of the contacts shows that a thin layer of Fe-Ti-Cr spinel and ilmenite formed on the IRUP side, while chromite on the UG2 side underwent grain coarsening with loss of interstitial space, and developed chemical gradients in Cr, Al, Fe and Ti. On a larger scale, the MLA data document changes in ore and gangue mineral assemblages through most of the meter-thick UG2 layer. This includes formation of secondary hydrous silicates, replacement of PGE- sulfides by PGE alloys and PGE- As-Sb-Bi-Te-Pb phases, and formation of secondary Ni-Cu-Fe sulfides after pentlandite and chalcopyrite.",

        "description": "Natural gas hydrates are non-stoichiometric crystalline compounds containing water and guest molecules such as CH4, C2H6, C3H8, CO2, etc. They are considered as a promising energy resource, a potential geohazard and a contributor to global climate warming. An accurate knowledge of the dissociation behavior of gas hydrates is a necessity for the recovery of natural gas hydrates and the assessment of potential risks of CH4 release from destabilized deposits. To explore the dissociation behavior of gas hydrates, Raman spectroscopy is regarded as a non-destructive and powerful tool. This technique enables to distinguish between guest molecules in the free gas or liquid phase, encased into a clathrate cavity or dissolved in an aqueous phase, therefore providing time-resolved information about the conditions of the guest molecules during the hydrate dissociation process. Experiments were carried out at the Micro-Raman Spectroscopy Laboratory, GFZ. Since the dissociation kinetics of sI hydrates may vary from that of sII hydrates, sI CH4 hydrates, sII binary hydrates and sII multicomponent mixed hydrates were investigated during the experiments. For the in situ Raman measurements, hydrates were synthesized in a high-pressure cell from pure water and the specific continuous gas flow which was the CH4-C3H8 gas mixture for binary hydrates and CH4-C2H6-C3H8-CO2 gas mixture for mixed hydrate system. The p-T condition of the experiment was initially set at 274 K and 7.0 MPa for the sI hydrates whereas 278 K and 3.0 MPa for sII hydrate systems. After the stabilization of the hydrates in the reactor, the temperature of the system was increased one step at a time to mimic global warming and initiate hydrate dissociation. In situ Raman spectroscopic measurements and microscopic observations were applied to record changes in hydrate compositions over the whole dissociation period until the hydrate phase was completely decomposed. Apart from this, hydrates were formed from ice powders and the specific gas\/gas mixtures in batch pressure vessels for several weeks. Gas hydrates were recovered and placed into a Linkam cooling stage for further ex situ Raman spectroscopic measurements. Again, the temperature of the stage gradually increased from 168 K onwards to study the dissociation process. In all three hydrate systems, one in situ Raman measurements and at least two repetitions of ex situ Raman measurements (3 repetitions for the CH4 hydrate system) were carried out, therefore resulting in 10 separate experimental tests. This dataset encompasses raw Raman spectra of the 10 experimental tests (4 tests for CH4 hydrates, 3 tests for CH4-C3H8 hydrates and 3 for mixed gas hydrates) which contained Raman shifts and the respective measured intensities. Each Raman spectrum was fitted to Gauss\/Lorentz function after an appropriate background correction to estimate the band areas and positions (Raman shift). The Raman band areas were then corrected with wavelength-independent cross-sections factors for each specific component. The concentration of each guest molecule in the hydrate phase was given as mol% in separate spreadsheets for three different hydrate systems as. Further details on the analytical setup, experimental procedures and composition calculation are provided in the following sections.",

However, the precise nature of interactions between OM and hydrothermal fluids are still debated as well as how the interconnected reactions develop over geological timescales. This dataset provides for the first time bulk, compositional and stable isotope data of hydrocarbons, biomarkers and organonitrogen, -sulfur and-oxygen (NSO) compounds for the mineralized Kupferschiefer Spremberg-Graustein field in Eastern Germany based on samples from two drill cores. The study aims to help to better understand the role that organic matter plays during the mineralisation and formation of the sedimentary ore deposit within the Kupferschiefer with a focus on stable hydrogen isotope compositions and NSO compositional data to especially address the origin and to assess the oxidative nature of the brines that caused the mineralization in the Spremberg-Graustein field. The data publication includes bulk, compositional and stable isotope data on inorganic metals and organic matter. The data about metal contents were generated using ICP-MS while those on the organic matter were generated using Rock-Eval pyrolysis, a microscope, a Soxhlet apparatus, medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC), gas chromatography with flame ionization (GC-FID) and mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS), gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS) and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (Fourier Transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, FT-ICR-MS) with Electrospray ionization (ESI) and Atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI).

        "description": "In coastal Arctic permafrost regions, thermokarst lagoons represent the transition state from a freshwater lacustrine to a marine environment, and receive little attention regarding their role for greenhouse gas production and release. The geochemical features of a thermokarst lagoon were compared with two thermokarst lakes on the Bykovsky Peninsula in northeastern Siberia. This data set includes pH, major cations and anions, alkalinity, salinity, and dissolved iron (ferric and ferrous) concentrations from porewater of lake and lagoon sediments; the concentration and stable isotopic signature of CH4 in small plug samples from the sediment cores; total carbon (TC), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total sulfur (TS) measured from the bulk sediment; and several biomarker indices (e.g. CPI, Paq) were calculated based on n-alkane concentrations to characterize the origin of organic matter (OM) in the lakes.",

        "description": "This dataset provides friction and elasticity data from ring shear and axial tests, respectively, on rock analogue materials used at the University Roma Tre (Rome, IT) in \u201cFoamquake\u201d, a novel seismotectonic analog model mimicking the megathrust seismic cycle (Mastella et al., under review). Two granular materials (quartz sand and Jasmine rice) have been characterized by means of internal friction coefficients \u00b5 and cohesions C. An elastic material (foam rubber) have been characterized by means of Young\u2019s modulus E and Poisson\u2019s ratio v. According to our analysis the granular materials show Mohr-Coulomb behaviour characterized by linear failure envelopes in the shear stress vs. normal load Mohr space. Peak, dynamic and reactivation friction coefficients of the quartz sand are \u00b5P = 0.69, \u00b5D = 0.56 and \u00b5R = 0.64, respectively. Cohesion ranges between 50 and 100 Pa. Rate-dependency of friction in quartz sand seems insignificant. Peak, dynamic and reactivation friction coefficients of the Jasmine rice are \u00b5P = 0.70, \u00b5D = 0.59 and \u00b5R = 0.61, respectively. Cohesion ranges between 30 and 50 Pa. Rate-weakening of Jasmine rice is c. 6% per tenfold change in shear velocity v. The Young\u2019s modulus of the foam rubber has been constrained to 30 kPa, its Poisson\u2019s ratio is v=0.1.",

        "description": "Porphyry copper deposits provide most of the world\u2019s, half its molybdenum reserves and are resources for Zn, Pb, Au, and Ag. The porphyry mineralization is inferred to form on time scales between 50 and 100kyrs whereby the mineralization forming magma chamber is generally built up by multiple intrusive events. The overall source magmatic system can be active for several millions of years. We used the Complex System Modeling Platform (CSMP++) to simultaneously model sill injection, heat transfer, the release of metal-bearing magmatic fluids, the multi-phase flow of saline hydrothermal fluids, and dynamic permeability variations with a continuum porous medium approach. Our modeling studies the volumetric injection rate and its impact on the growth of the magma chamber and the Cu-ore shell but also investigates the influence of hydrothermal convection and fluid release. The setup of each modeling run is changed slightly, either by changing the influx rate, changing the geometry of the magma chamber, or changing the location of fluid release. CSMP was modified to produce vtk and vtu files every 100 years which were read into the Paraview 4.3.1 software to perform the post-processing (including the calculation of the copper enrichment factor and the pore fluid factor). Paraview was then used to produce the displayed videos.",

Additionally, the REFLECT team will compare those field data with data from lab experiments performed at near natural conditions. Samples of type C fluids were taken from several sites in Germany, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands. The samples were analysed for major and minor ions, dissolved gases and isotopes. In order to gain information about the increased methane content (about 65 vol-%) in the gas samples of the Gro\u00df Sch\u00f6nebeck production well (GrSk05\/05) collected in February 2021 as compared to previous samples in 2010-2018 (10-14 vol-%), three gas samples were sampled by GFZ on 02 March 2021 at the valve at the wellhead when releasing the pressure from the wellhead. Main gas composition was measured by GFZ indicating again predominantly CH4 (63,9-64,2 Vol-%) followed by N2 (30,9 \u2013 31,2 vol.-%) with minor amounts of H2 (3,4 vol-%) and CO2 (0,01-0,04 vol-%). Potential reasons for the increased methane content could be either microbial activity or contribution of fluid \/ gas from a different source within the reservoir. To determine the origin of methane, therefore, isotope analyses were performed. The samples arrived at Hydroisotop on March 13th 2021 for the analysis of higher hydrocarbons (C2-C5) and their isotopic composition (13C-CO2, 13C -CH4, 13C-CxHy and 2H-CH4). Together with the measured high amounts of higher hydrocarbons (ethane, propane etc.) they indicate a rather thermogenic source of the hydrocarbons. To better clarify the question of the source of methane, additionally, two downhole water samples from two different depths (1500 and 4000 m) were taken by GFZ on 09th and 10th of June 2021 and sent to Hydroisotop for analysis of main cations and anions, heavy metals, trace elements and isotopes (13C-CH4) in July 2021. The water sample composition resembles those of earlier measurements of samples collected in Gro\u00df Sch\u00f6nebeck (e.g. Regenspurg et al., 2010). However, since the well had not been in operation for a while a depth differentiation between the sample from 4000 m and the one from 1500 m is obvious. This was already visible by the black precipitate observed in the 4000 m sample, whereas the sample at 1500 m showed da reddish precipitate of presumably iron oxides. It should be noted that the nitrate content of the water samples is unusually high since reducing conditions are expected. This could have been caused by air contact of the sample and subsequent oxidation. Furthermore, a reduced silicon content shows in sample 365871 compared to sample 365870.

One of the specific goals was to collect fluid samples from several saline fluids from geothermal sites across Europe, determine their properties, and thus contribute to the Fluid Atlas (WP3). Additionally, the REFLECT team will compare those field data with data from lab experiments performed at near natural conditions. Samples of type C fluids were taken from several sites in Germany, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands. The samples were analysed for major and minor ions, dissolved gases and isotopes. At Neustadt-Glewe one thermal water sample was taken by GFZ on June 02, 2021 and sent to Hydroisotop for analysis of main cations, anions, heavy metals, DOC, gases and isotopes (18O, 2H, 18O-SO4, 2H, 13C-DIC, 13C-CO2, 13C-CH4, 13C-CxHy, 2H-CH4, 34S-SO4, 34S-H2S, 2H-CH4).

        "description": "\u2013 A temporary seismic network consisting of 48 long-term and 15 short-term stations was deployed from June 2021 to June 2022. The network comprises 27 broadband stations and 20 short period geophones from the Ruhr-University Bochum, the Geophysical Instrument Pool Potsdam (GIPP) and the RWTH Aachen. The inter-station spacing of the longer-term network is about 2 km and the total extent of the network is about 20 km. The densely populated area and vicinity of active pit mining demanded a balance between dense station placement and avoidance of anthropogenic noise sources. The network serves as a pre-study for the installment of a field laboratory in Eschweiler-Weisweiler, Germany. Details can be found in the accompanying data publication (Finger et al., in preparation).

        "description": "Extensive passive seismic monitoring was carried out between September 2017 and September 2018 over the Los Humeros geothermal field in Mexico. This experiment, in addition to several geophysical, geological, and geochemical surveys was conducted in the framework of the European H2020 and Mexican CONACyT-SENER project GEMex for a better understanding of the structures and behavior of the local geothermal system currently under exploitation, and for investigating future development areas. 25 broadband stations (22 Trillium C-120s and 3 Trillium C-20 PH) recording at 200 Hz, and 20 short period stations (Mark L-4C-3D) recording at 100 Hz comprised the network which is sub-divided into two sub-networks. An inner and denser (~1.6-2 km inter-station distance) pseudo-rhomboidal array (27 stations) was laid out to cover the producing zone and retrieve local seismicity mainly associated to injection and production operations, and to comply with beamforming of ambient noise and time reverse imaging techniques. An outer and sparser (~5 km minimum spacing) array was placed at around 30 km radius surrounding the inner network, and was mainly dedicated to larger scale imaging techniques, such as seismic ambient noise tomography, and regional earthquakes tomography. The GEMex project is supported by the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement No 727550 and the Mexican Energy Sustainability Fund CONACYT-SENER, project 2015-04-68074.

        "description": "Strong earthquakes cause transient perturbations of the near Earth\u2019s surface system. These include the widespread landsliding and subsequent mass movement and the loading of rivers with sediments. In addition, rock mass is shattered during the event, forming cracks that affect rock strength and hydrological conductivity. Often overlooked in the immediate aftermath of an earthquake, these perturbations can represent a major part of the overall disaster with an impact that can last for years before restoring to background conditions. Thus, the relaxation phase is part of the seismically induced change by an earthquake and needs to be monitored in order to understand the full impact of earthquakes on the Earth system. Early June 2015, shortly after the April 2015 Mw7.9 Gorkha earthquake, we installed an array of 12 seismometers and geophones and 6 weather stations in the upper Bhotekoshi catchment, covering an area of ~50 km2. The seismic network was optimized for the monitoring of Earth surface processes (landsliding, mass wasting river processes, debris flows) and for the monitoring of properties of the shallow subsurface by coda analysis. To achieve the latter aim and to probe different scales and depths, seismometers were installed with inter-station distances from about 80m to 9km. In particular, in each of two locations close to the Bhotekoshi river, three seismometers were installed in small arrays with inter-station distances of about 100m. The seismic array is part of a wider data acquisition strategy including hydrometric measurements and high resolution optical (RapidEye) and radar imagery (TanDEM TerraSAR-X). Waveform data is available from the GEOFON data centre, under network code XN, and is embargoed until Jan 2021.",

        "description": "The lithosphere of Iberia has been formed through a number of processes of continental collision and extension. In Lower Paleozoic, the collision of three tectonics blocks produced the Variscan Orogeny, the main event of formation of the Iberian lithosphere. The subsequent Mesozoic rifting and breakup of the Pangea had a profound effect on the continental crust of the western border of Iberia. Since the Miocene, the southern interaction between Africa and Iberia is characterized by a diffuse convergent margin that originates a vast area of deformation. The impact of this complex tectonic in the structure of the Iberian Lithosphere remains an incognito, especially in its western part beneath Portugal. While the surface geology is considerably studied and documented, the crustal and lithospheric structures are not well constrained. The existing knowledge relating the observed surface geology and Lithospheric deep structures is sparse and sometimes incoherent. The seismic activity observed along West Iberia is intensely clustered on few areas, namely on north Alentejo, Estremadura and Regua-Verin fault systems. Some of the problems to address are: What is the relation between surface topography and the deep crustal\/lithospheric structure? How was it influenced by the past tectonic events? Which was the deep driving factor behind the tectonic units observed at surface: Lithosphere-Astenosphere boundary structure or deeper mantle structure? How the upper mantle and the Lithosphere-Astenosphere transition zone accommodated the past subduction? Which is its role and influence of the several tectonic units, and their contacts, in the present tectonic regime and in the stress field observed today? Is the anomalous seismicity and associated crustal deformation rates, due to an inherited structure from past orogenies? The main goal of this work is a 3D detailed image of the \u201cslice\u201d of the Earth beneath Western Iberia, by complementing the permanent seismic networks operating in Portugal and Spain. The different scales involved require the usage of several passive seismological methods: Local-Earthquake Tomography for fine structure of seismogenic areas, ambient noise tomography for regional crustal structure, Receiver Functions for Lithospheric structure and Surface-wave tomography for large scale Listosphere-Astenosphere structure. Crustal and Mantle seismic anisotropy analysis, coupled with source analysis and correlation with current geodetic measurements will allow establishing a reference 3D anisotropy model of present and past processes.",

Seismic stations were composed of 3C broadband Trillium compact seismometer, a Cube datalogger and a 12V (D-cell types, stacked) battery pack.The experiment splits into three surveys performed at three different sites, one after the other, from july to august 2016. In the first experiment, we deploy 11 stations, 9 of them on a flat sandy area covering, partly, immobile ice that seems to be blocked between the Bailey Glacier (upstream) and the Apusinikajik glacier (downstream). The 9 sensors are placed a few hundreds of meters from the Apusinikajik lateral front, the last 2 are placed on the glacier next to the collapsing front. In the second and third experiment (chronologically speaking), we deploy 10 and 8 stations, respectively. Each deployment is performed along a Bailey valley transect. The first one intercepts the front-end of the glacier and the sub-glacial river exit (flow of several m3\/s). The second transect is performed some 850m upstream.

        "description": "Mean S-wave coda quality factors (mean-Qc) were estimated from active ultrasonic transmission (UT) measurements acquired during the STIMTEC project in the URL Reiche Zeche (Saxony, Germany). We used S-coda waves of 88 selected UT measurements carried out in 3 differently oriented boreholes (BH10, BH12, BH16) to estimate the spatial change of the coda quality factor in the targeted rock volume, an anisotropic metamorphic gneiss. We also analysed temporal variation in attenuation before and after hydraulic stimulations performed in two boreholes (BH10, BH17). We formed in total 8 UT groups (see data table \"2022-004_Blanke-and-Boese_mean_UT_event_locations\") from neighbouring UT measurements within different depths and from separated time intervals (see also Tab. 1 in Blanke et al. 2023), and compare mean-Qc estimates of centre frequencies ranging 3-21 kHz of octave-width frequency bands. Our results show a characteristic frequency-dependence and we find that mean-Qc estimates reveal temporal-variations of attenuation more significantly than those obtained from velocity measurements. The temporal variations are strongly connected to hydraulic stimulation activities resulting in a reduction of the coda quality factor where AE events occurred. Analysis of mean-Qc estimates after a temporal resting phase (with no activity in the rock volume) suggests that frequencies &gt; 15 kHz indicate healing of small-scale fractures induced by injections. The study shows that coda analysis is a powerful tool for the detection of damage zones and for monitoring changes of the local fracture network within reservoirs important for exploitation or underground storage of gases and liquids.",

        "description": "Between early 2018 and late 2019 the STIMTEC hydraulic stimulation experiment was performed at ca.~130 m below surface at the Reiche Zeche underground research laboratory in Freiberg, Saxony\/Germany. The project aimed at gaining insight into the creation and growth of fractures in anisotropic and heterogeneous metamorphic gneiss , to develop and optimise hydraulic stimulation techniques and to control the associated induced seismicity under in situ conditions at the mine-scale. These aspects of failure and associated seismicity are important for the development of enhanced geothermal energy systems. A combined seismic network consisted of 12 single-component acoustic emission sensors (sensitivity 1-100 kHz) and three single-component Wilcoxon accelerometers (sensitivity 50 Hz-25 kHz) were installed in boreholes drilled into the test volume, surrounding the stimulation site (Figure 1). A stimulation borehole with 63 m length was drilled with 15\u00b0 northward inclination. This data set of 314 active ultrasonic transmission (UT) measurements is supplementary to Boese et al. (2021, in review), which introduces the STIMTEC experiment and its active measurement campaigns. This data set was used to derive an anisotropic velocity model for the STIMTEC rock volume. The active seismic data provided here are from six boreholes (BH09, BH10, BH12, BH15, BH16, BH17) as shown in Figure 1. of the associated data description. There are three tables provided as metadata that contain the STIMTEC sensor coordinates, event information of the 314 UT measurements and the UT picks. The UT measurements were recorded with a sampling rate of 1 MHz and results from an automatic stack of 1024 UT pulses generated by the ultrasonic transmitter and recorded by the STIMTEC sensors. The UT measurements are saved in binary file format (fsf file format). Fsf-files can be processed with FOCI software: https:\/\/www.induced.pl\/software\/foci Each fsf file contains 32768 samples, which corresponds to 0.032768 seconds.

        "description": "An experimental investigation was implemented to explore the mechanical parameters of the Odenwald reservoir granitoids. The specimen within this research project was the Odenwald Granodiorite (ODG) which was extracted from the quarry on Bergstrasse in Heppenheim, Germany. The study enfolds fundamental mechanical features from intact cylindrical rock specimens. The ODG was extracted from an active quarry and the extracted blocks were drilled into cylindrical samples. Thereafter, the samples were operated on the Mechanical Testing System (MTS) from the GFZ in Potsdam. This offers the possibility to test the rock strength, including tensile and compressive strength values, of different kind of rock materials. Fundamental mechanical analysis including Brazilian Disk Test (BD), Uniaxial Compressive Strength Test (UCS) and Triaxial Compression Strength Test (Triax) were part of this experimental investigation. Firstly, the BD was executed to achieve the tensile strength (T0) at different loading rates (0.001 mm\/s and 0.0003 mm\/s) as well as the fracture toughness mode I (KIC) after Guo from 1993. These samples have a size of 50 mm in diameter and 25 mm in length. Secondly, the UCS resulted in the Poisson\u2019s ratio (\u0475), the static Young\u2019s modulus (E) and the maximum uniaxial compressive strength (Co). Thirdly, the Triax was done under saturated and dry conditions. Hereby, the maximum compressive strength (\u03c31), the compressibility (C) and the Biot coefficient were calculated from raw data. The Triax experiments have four different setups. Three different confining pressure were executed at different specimens, 20 MPa, 40 MPa and 60 MPa. Additionally, a multiple failure test was executed including all three confining pressure steps. Both experimental setups, UCS and Triax, have samples of the size of 50 mm in diameter and 100 mm in length. All these samples were dried at 60\u00b0C for at least 24h and only some Triax experiments were done under saturated conditions. The data publication includes the raw data files from the experiment as well as files with calculated results for the above mentioned different mechanical parameters. These files are either given as DAT files or Microsoft Excel sheets summarized in a Zip folder. For further details, the full description of the data and methods is provided in the data description file.

In this data compilation we provide general data on the location of the boreholes and data on the applied methods and the interpretation of petrophysical properties (density, porosity, permeability, thermal properties) obtained by core analysis and well-log interpretation. Because cores were available for the E GrSk 3\/90 borehole only, most of the data is referring to the borehole that was drilled more or less vertically. The other borehole (Gt GrSk 4\/05) is a deviated well, drilled as a geothermal production well. Further on, we provide the main interpreted structural reflector horizons of the geological model from surface to the assumed top of sedimentary Carboniferous (for discussion of the uncertainty of this boundary please consider the comments in Norden et al., 2022) and the horizons and 3D grid properties of a parameterized simulation grid for the deep geothermal target (sedimentary Rotliegend and Permo-Carboniferous volcanic rocks).",

In a segment along that margin, older mafic and ultramafic volcanic rocks were thrust over the youngest strata (quartz-rich sandstones and conglomerates) before being folded and imbricated in thrust slices. Samples described in this publication comprise tabular data of (1) sample locations and crystallization ages of zircons which were extracted from thin tuffaceous units in the thrust sheet, (2) analytical data from laser ablation \u2013 inductively coupled plasma \u2013 mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), supporting these ages, and (3) quantitative measurements of ductily deformed conglomerate clasts. Field data were collected 2012-2019; U-Pb analyses performed in 2020. The data presented here are the basis for geological maps and cross sections, and are visualized as concordia diagrams form part of in the related publication (Heubeck et al.. 2023).",

        "description": "In the Western Tauern Window, Zillertal Alps (Austria\/Italy), metasediments of a Mesozoic intra-montane basin (\"Pfitsch-M\u00f6rchner basin\"; Vesel\u00e1 and Lammerer, 2008) are exposed. The (me-ta)sediments were deposited on a Variscan basement, which comprises different types of meta-granitoids and their (Pre)-Variscan metamorphic country rocks. The chemical composition (major and trace elements) of these rocks is presented for 205 samples. In the metasediments (103 samples), we distinguish the following units (from base to top): metaconglomerate (14 samples) \u2013 mica schist (19) \u2013 carbonate-mica schist (9) \u2013 tourmaline gneiss (35) \u2013 lazulite quartzite (25) \u2013 marble (1). In the basement to the NW of the basin, we distinguish two different types of orthogneiss (both Zentralgneis of the Tux unit, in the local nomenclature two varieties Augenflasergneis and Schrammacher gneiss; 32 samples) and the roof pendant of these gneisses with serpentinite (10 samples), amphibolite, and paragneiss (no analyses presented). In the SE of the basin we distinguish orthogneiss from the Zillertal branch of the Zentralgneis (7 samples), biotite-chlorite-plagioclase gneiss (9 samples), amphibolite, and (Pre-)Variscan graphitic micaschist with the local name Furtschagl schist (no analyses presented), and at the base of the basin sediments a schistose pyrite quartzite (31) with lenses of magnetite-chloritoide-staurolite-chlorite rich rocks (13 samples MCSC-lenses, interpreted as paleosol, Barrientos and Selverstone, 1987). From a subset of these samples (23 samples), rare earth elements were determined, and from another subset of 25 samples 11B\/10B boron isotope ratios and whole rock B-contents. This extends a previously published data set of B isotope ratios in tourmaline from the metasedimen-tary unit (Berryman et al. 2017). For a test of stratigraphic correlation, typical rocks from the meta-conglomerate, the carbonate-mica schist, lazulite quartzite, and marble (one sample each) were analyzed for 87Sr\/86Sr isotope ratios.",

(2022). The paleoclimate time-slices correspond to Pre-Industrial (~1850 CE, PI), Mid-Holocene (~6 ka, MH), Last Glacial Maximum (~21 ka, LGM) and Pliocene (~3 Ma, PLIO). The FCI (by segregation ice growth) is predicted using the approach of Andersen et al. (2015), as a function of subsurface thermal gradient and volume of (and distance to) liquid water. The paleo-temperature reconstructions are obtained from ECHAM5 general circulation model (GCM) at T159 spatial resolution (80 km * 80 km) by Mutz et al. (2018). The spatial resolution of FCI dataset is same as ECHAM5 GCM simulations (i.e. 80 km * 80 km). The dataset comprises the following: - Scripts (Python) for modeling FCI for approach described in Sharma et al. (2022). - Global FCI distribution as netCDF and ascii formats. The data is available in both netCDF and ascii formats. However, the model code (attached Python scripts) currently supports only netCDF format. The model scripts can be freely utilized for regional and local studies which require finer resolution dataset.

        "title": "A global database of radiogenic Nd and Sr isotopes in marine and terrestrial samples (V. 2.0)",
        "description": "The database presented here contains radiogenic neodymium and strontium isotope ratios measured on both terrestrial and marine sediments. It was compiled to help assessing sediment provenance and transport processes for various time intervals. This can be achieved by either mapping sediment isotopic signature and\/or fingerprinting source areas using statistical tools (e.g. Blanchet, 2018b, 2018a). The database has been built by incorporating data from the literature and the SedDB database and harmonizing the metadata, especially units and geographical coordinates. The original data were processed in three steps. Firstly, a specific attention has been devoted to provide geographical coordinates to each sample in order to be able to map the data. When available, the original geographical coordinates from the reference (generally DMS coordinates, with different precision standard) were transferred into the decimal degrees system. When coordinates were not provided, an approximate location was derived from available information in the original publication. Secondly, all samples were assigned a set of standardized criteria that help splitting the dataset in specific categories. We defined categories associated with the sample location (\"Region\", \"Sub-region\", \"Location\", which relate to location at continental to city\/river scale) or with the sample types (terrestrial samples \u2013 \u201caerosols\u201d, \u201csoil sediments\u201d, \u201criver sediments\u201d, \u201crocks\u201d - or marine samples \u2013\u201cmarine sediment\u201d or \u201ctrap sample\u201d). Thirdly, samples were discriminated according to their deposition age, which allowed to compute average values for specific time intervals (see attached table \"Age_determination_Sediment_Cores_V2.txt\"). A first version of the database was published in September 2018 and presented data for the African sector. A second version was published in April 2019, in which the dataset has been extended to reach a global extent. The dataset will be further updated bi-annually to increase the geographical resolution and\/or add other type of samples. This dataset consists of two tab separated tables: \"Dataset_Nd_Sr_isotopes_V2.txt\" and \"Age_determination_Sediment_Cores_V2.txt\". \"Dataset_Nd_Sr_isotopes_V2.txt\" contains the assembled dataset of marine and terrestrial Nd and\/or Sr concentration and isotopes, together with sorting criteria and geographical locations. \"Age_determination_Sediment_Cores_V2.txt\" contains all background information concerning the determination of the isotopic signature of specific time intervals (depth interval, number of samples, mean and standard deviation). Column headers are explained in respective metadata comma-separated files. A full reference list is provided in the file \u201cReferences_Database_Nd_Sr_isotopes_V2.rtf\u201d. Finally, R code for mapping the data and running statistical analyses is also available for this dataset (Blanchet, 2018b, 2018a).",

        "description": "The profile 2N was recorded in 1986 as part of the DEKORP project, the German deep seismic reflection program. The seismic survey of the ca. 220 km long line 2N was conducted to investigate the deep crustal structure of the eastern Rhenish Massif and the Muensterland Basin with high-fold near-vertical incidence vibroseis acquisition. The objectives of the survey were to image the Variscan structures in detail with respect to their specific transitions, to obtain evidence about vertical tectonic processes during the Variscan orogenesis, to understand the causes of observed gravity and magnetic anomalies and to recognize and define the Variscan front to the north. In addition, the line contributed to the International Lithosphere Program (ILP) and the former European Geotraverse (EGT). The first outcomes of the survey were presented by Reichert (1988). A detailed description of seismic results is provided by Franke et al. (1990) as well as by DEKORP Research Group (1990) and supplemented by many other researches. The Technical Report of line 2N gives complete information about acquisition and processing parameters. The European Variscides, extending from the French Central Massif to the East European Platform, originated during the collision between Gondwana and Baltica in the Late Palaeozoic. Due to involvement of various crustal blocks in the orogenesis, the mountain belt is subdivided into distinct zones. The external fold-and-thrust belts of the Rhenohercynian and Saxothuringian as well as the predominantly crystalline body of the Moldanubian dominate the central European segment of the Variscides. Polyphase tectonic deformation, magmatism and metamorphic processes led to a complex interlinking between the units. The nearly S-N striking DEKORP 2N line reveals an almost complete cross-section through the Rhenohercynian Zone. The profile runs from the Taunus Mountains, i.e. the southeastern rim of the Rhenish Massif over the Lahn-Dill Trough, through the Ebbe Mountains to the borehole Muensterland 1 in the Muensterland Basin, which belongs to the sub-Variscan Foredeep. The profile is the northern prolongation of DEKORP 2S. Line DEKORP 2Q crosses line 2N perpendicularly in its northern part extending northeastwards to the borehole Versmold 1.",

        "title": "Data Supplement to: Cosmogenic 10Be in river sediment: where grain size matters and why",
        "description": "Concentrations of in-situ-produced cosmogenic 10Be in river sediment are widely used to estimate catchment-average denudation rates. Typically, the 10Be concentrations are measured in the sand fraction of river sediment. However, the grain size of bedload sediment in most bedrock rivers covers a much wider range. Where 10Be concentrations depend on grain size, denudation rate estimates based on the sand fraction alone are potentially biased. To date, knowledge about catchment attributes that may induce grain-size-dependent 10Be concentrations is incomplete or has only been investigated in modelling studies. Here we present an empirical study on the occurrence of grain-size-dependent 10Be concentrations and the potential controls of hillslope angle, precipitation, lithology, and abrasion. \n      We first conducted a study focusing on the sole effect of precipitation in four granitic catchments located on a climate gradient in the Chilean Coastal Cordillera. We found that observed grain size dependencies of 10Be concentrations in the most-arid and most-humid catchments could be explained by the effect of precipitation on both the scouring depth of erosion processes and the depth of the mixed soil layer. Analysis of a global dataset of published 10Be concentrations in different grain sizes (n=73 catchments) \u2013 comprising catchments with contrasting hillslope angles, climate, lithology, and catchment size \u2013 revealed a similar pattern. Lower 10Be concentrations in coarse grains (defined as \u201cnegative grain size dependency\u201d) emerge frequently in catchments which likely have thin soil and where deep-seated erosion processes (e.g. landslides) excavate grains over a larger depth interval. These catchments include steep (&gt; 25\u00b0) and humid catchments (&gt; 2000mm yr-1). Furthermore, we found that an additional cause of negative grain size dependencies may emerge in large catchments with weak lithologies and long sediment travel distances (&gt; 2300\u20137000 m, depending on lithology) where abrasion may lead to a grain size distribution that is not representative for the entire catchment. The results of this study can be used to evaluate whether catchment-average denudation rates are likely to be biased in particular catchments.\n      Samples from the Chilean Coastal Cordillera were processed in the Helmholtz Laboratory for the Geochemistry of the Earth Surface (HELGES). 10Be\/9Be ratios were measured at the University of Cologne and normalized to the KN01-6-2 and KN01-5-3 standards. Denudation rates were calculated using a time-independent scaling scheme according to Lal (1991) and Stone (2002) (St scaling scheme) and the SLHL production rate of 4.01 at g-1 yr-1 as reported by Phillips et al. (2016)\n      The global compilation exists of studies that measured 10Be concentrations in different grain sizes from the same sample location. We only included river basins of &lt;5000 km2 which measured 10Be concentrations in at least one sand-sized fraction &lt;2 mm and at least one coarser fraction &gt;2 mm. Catchment parameters have been recalculated using a 90-m SRTM DEM.\n      The data are presented in Excel and csv tables. Table S1 describes the characteristics of the samples catchments, Table S2 includes the grain size dependent 10Be-concentrations measured during this study and Table 3 the global compilation of grain size dependent 10Be-concentrations. All samples of this study (the Chilean Coastal Cordillera) are assigned with International Geo Sample Numbers (IGSN).

Partial melting of carbonates produces dolomitic melts whereby the trace element signature largely depends on the Ca\/Mg-ratio of the bulk system. For instance, REE will be fractionated by two orders or magnitude between Ca magnesite and dolomitic melt. In contrast, melting of Ca rich carbonates will not lead to a significant REE fractionation. The here published data set includes all chemical analysis (major and trace elment composition) of run products and starting materials. From this data set we obtained the melting relations and partition coefficients reported in Sieber et al. (2020); Sieber et al. (under review).",

        "description": "The Quaternary Drilling at the Rehhag under the supervision of members of the Institut f\u00fcr Geologie (QDR-RE-IfG) was interested in the unconsolidated sediment infill of a bedrock trough in the Northern Alpine Foreland (NAF). Such bedrock troughs, now hidden beneath their sediment infill and\/or in lakes, occur in formerly and currently glaciated areas, and are linked to increased glacial erosion. The base of these bedrock troughs is located beneath today's base level, which puts them beyond fluvial erosion, and this is why they are referred to as over-deepenings. Such overdeepenings can be found in the vicinity of the Alps which includes the NAF. After the formation or re-occupation of such overdeepenings by glacier ice these troughs provide accommodation space for the deposition of sediments. Hence, overdeepenings are likely to preserve sediments through glacial-interglacial cycles. As erosive agents, glaciers re-shape landscapes, and excavate and re-use sediments of previous glaciations which makes the preservation of intact sedimentary sequences through multiple glacial cycles unlikely. These repeated cut-and-fill cycles limit the Quaternary sedimentary record and make the investigation of the number and chronology of Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles difficult. Overdeepenings, however, can preserve fractionated and probably intact sedimentary sequences throughout multiple glaciations. Hence, accessing the sediment infill of overdeepened bedrock troughs through core drillings provides insight into phases of the Quaternary at locations where formerly little information was available. To gain new insight into the Mid- to Late-Pleistocene sedimentary record in the Bern area (Switzerland) the drilling QDR-RE-IfG was conducted in Bern-B\u00fcmpliz, where a minor branch of the Aare Valley overdeepening is located in which Quaternary sediments at least 150 ka in age were expected. In Bern-B\u00fcmpliz, at the Rehhag, the uppermost 30 m of the sedimentary succession are accessible in an abandoned clay pit. The drilling reached 211.5 m driller's depth, recovering 208.5 m of unconsolidated sediment and, below a sharp contact, 3 m of Miocene Molasse bedrock. The recovery of intact core from unconsolidated sediment is challenging. Nevertheless, 92.3% of the core material was recovered in 1 m-long plastic liners in pristine condition. As the drilling reached the bedrock it is the first scientific drilling that recovered the full sedimentary suite in a part of the Aare Valley overdeepening. Within the sedimentary succession two sequences (A = lower, B = upper) were identified. Each of the sequences is initiated by the deposition of glacial till that is overlain by lacustrine or glacio-lacustrine sediments. First luminescence ages indicate a depositional age between 250 and 340 ka for sequence B. The drill core was transported from the drill site to the Institute of Geological Sciences, University of Bern, where it was analyzed and sampled. The first step in the analysis was scanning the whole core contained in the liners on a Multi Sensor Core Logger (MSCL; Geotek Ltd.) which provided measurements of the core (\u03b3-)density, p-wave velocity and magnetic susceptibility. The liners were then opened under light sensitive conditions, the cores split in half to allow their macroscopic description, and one half was sealed from light and other alterating influences. After the description, the core was documented with a digital line scanner on the MSCL. After the documentation, a vane meter was used to determine the shear strength of the material and samples for pollen analysis, analysis of the carbon content, provenance analysis, and the measurement of cosmogenic nuclides 10Be and 26Al were extracted. This report provides limited information about the drilling operation, describes the available datasets form scanning and sample analysis, and the results of the first data processing as well as the tools used in the data analysis.",

The profile was recovered during a drilling campaign (March and April 2019) as part of the German Science Foundation (DFG) priority research program SPP-1803 \u201cEarthShape: Earth Surface Shaping by Biota\u201d which aims at understanding weathering of plutonic rock in dependency on different climatic conditions. The goal of the drilling campaign was to recover the entire weathering profile spanning from the surface to the weathering front and to investigate the weathering processes at depth. To this end, we used rock samples obtained by drilling and soil\/saprolite samples from a manually dug 2 m deep soil pit next to the borehole. To elucidate the role of iron-bearing minerals for the weathering, we measured the magnetic susceptibility, determined the mineral content and analysed the geochemistry as well as the composition of Fe-bearing minerals (M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy) in selected samples.",

        "description": "This data publication presents data from a solaroptical spectral investigation in the area of the Rammelsberg non-ferrous metal mine in the Harz Mountains near the city of Goslar. The investigation refers to the local communion stone quarry (\u201cKommunionssteinbruch\u201d) above the former mining area. As this is a nature conservation zone, all measurements were carried out in-situ without any physical sampling action. The field measurements were carried out in June 2019 in cooperation with Bergbau Goslar GmbH and the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ). The data were collected within the research project ReMon (Remote Monitoring of Tailings Using Satellites and Drones, https:\/\/www.gfz-potsdam.de\/en\/section\/remote-sensing-and-geoinformatics\/projects\/remon\/) which aims at developing a prototypical monitoring system for mine tailings by using different sensors scaling from satellite- to drone-based. The data were analysed in the unpublished B.Sc. thesis of Constantin Hildebrand (Hildebrand, 2019). Sixteen different surface materials were determined and examined on-site. Point and imaging hyperspectral data were acquired (with the spectroradiometer PSR+ 3500 operating in the range of 350 - 2500 nm and with the Cubert FireflEYEUHD-185 hyperspectral camera with a range of 450 - 950 nm, respectively), both data sets are presented as spectral libraries. Chemical analyses of the samples were performed by using Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS). LIBS data were collected using a handheld LIBS analyzer, the SciAps Z-300. In this data publication the different in-situ measurements are presented for each of the sixteen samples. Detailed information about the analysed material, the area of spectral sampling and geochemical analyses are explained in this report and can also be found in the additional Excel\u00ae sheet provided with the data.",

        "description": "The 36 km long line 4Q was recorded in 1985 as part of the DEKORP project, the German continental seismic reflection program. The aim of the survey was to explore important tectonic structures through the regional tectonic trend of the Bavarian Forest (NW-SE) with high-fold near-vertical incidence vibroseis acquisition. Details of the experiment, first results and interpretations were published by DEKORP Research Group (1987, 1988). The Technical Report of line 4Q gives complete information about acquisition and processing parameters. The European Variscides, extending from the French Central Massif to the East European Platform, originated during the collision between Gondwana and Baltica in the Late Palaeozoic. Due to involvement of various crustal blocks in the orogenesis, the mountain belt is subdivided into distinct zones. The external fold-and-thrust belts of the Rhenohercynian and Saxothuringian as well as the predominantly crystalline body of the Moldanubian dominate the central European segment of the Variscides. Polyphase tectonic deformation, magmatism and metamorphic processes led to a complex interlinking between the units. The Moldanubian unit contains blocks of pre-Variscan crust and their Palaezoic cover. During the Variscan orogeny the Moldanubian crust was thrust towards the NW over the Saxothuringian foreland. Both units were welded together by a low-pressure metamorphism accompanied by polyphase deformation (DEKORP Research Group, 1987, 1988). The SW-NE striking line 4Q runs perpendicular to the gneisses of the Bavarian Forest at the southwestern margin of the Bohemian Massif, a part of the Moldanubian Zone. In the southwest the profile crosses the NW-SE striking Bavarian Pfahl. The 150 km long quartz vein is a dextral shear zone with cataclastic as well as ductile deformation and extensive quartz mineralization (DEKORP Research Group, 1988). In the northeast DEKORP 4Q intersects the Hoher Bogen, an amphibolitic nappe, belonging to the western margin of the Tepla-Taus-Complex which is marked by an important volume of mafic metamorphic rocks (DEKORP Research Group, 1988). The profile 4Q traverses DEKORP 4N at its northeastern end almost perpendicularly.",

        "description": "The basin sediments of Lake Constance encompass superior records of glacial to late glacial and Holocene environmental conditions but were hitherto not recovered from greater depths due to the lack of high-quality but inexpensive coring instruments. In a test and commissioning campaign in 2019, a new scientific coring device, called Hipercorig, was deployed and recovered from two parallel boreholes a 20 and a 24 m long drillcore and one two-m-long surface core (Harms et al. 2020, Schaller et al. 2022). The drill site is in 200 m deep waters close to the northwestern lake shoreline near the town of Hagnau and was selected based on new seismic surveys. They revealed an up to 150 m thick sediment fill of the overdeepened Lake Constance basin created by several advance and retreat cycles of the Rhine Glacier during the mid to late Quaternary. The deposits comprise proglacial sediments overlain by glaciolacustrine and finally lake strata. The latter make up the top 12 m of the core recovered while below sandy intercalations indicate downward increasing influence of dynamic sedimentation pulses that were deposited through subaquatic channel systems fed by declining glaciers and meltwater pulses from the north. The cores retrieved were sampled for microbiology and pore fluids at University of Constance (Germany). They were opened at Bern University (Switzerland) in fall 2019, sedimentologically described, instrumentally logged, and sampled for further studies including age dating. These data served to identify 14 lithotypes that were differentiated into three chronostratigraphic units based on a 14C- and OSL-based age model. The cores section base with the proglacial unit is about 13.7 ka BP old while the lacustrine strata cover B\u00f8lling-Aler\u00f8d and Holocene ages. A prominent turbiditic event layer could be dated at 9.5 ka BP, coeval with the largest Holocene Alpine rock slide, the Flimser Bergsturz, that caused damming of the river Rhine and finally an outburst reaching as turbidite even northern Lake Constance. These initially gained data sets and the instruments utilized are described in the data description.",

One aim was to reveal the sources and dynamics of fluid movement as well as temporal and spatial distribution of fluids in a potentially weakened cavern rim. Over a period of three years pressure and gas monitoring was carried out along a transect from a cavernous structure to undisturbed rock salt. In addition, temperature and relative humidity data from the underground gallery were recorded. The gas inflow into isolated borehole sections provided an insight into short- and long-term changes of gas migration patterns in rock salt. Pressure increases of up to 4kPa\/day and CO2 concentrations of up to 1.2%, especially at the start of the campaign were measured. The gas migration is coupled to discrete fractures and was limited spatially and temporary. Overall, gas occurrences were not correlated to their distance to the cavern, suggesting no wide-ranging fluid-rock interaction within the rim of the investigated natural cavernous structure in rock salt.",

        "title": "Kaghan Valley, Pakistan: metamorphic rocks, their chemistry and age",
        "description": "This data set is the source of my doctoral thesis and of three resulting publications. Through whole rock geochemistry of selected samples and microprobe and geochronological analyses of key minerals, formerly selected by extensive microscopical studies, standard geothermobarometry and modelling was applied. It has been shown that metamorphic rocks, in particular, the eclogites of the northern Kaghan Valley, Pakistan, were buried to depths of 140-100 km (36-30 kbar) at 790-640\u00b0C. Subsequently, cooling during decompression (exhumation) towards 40-35 km (17-10 kbar) and 630-580\u00b0C has been superseded by a phase of reheating to about 720-650\u00b0C at roughly the same depth before final exhumation has taken place. In the southern-most part of the Kaghan Valley, amphibolite facies assemblages with formation conditions similar to the deduced reheating phase indicate a juxtaposition of both areas after the eclogite facies stage and thus a stacking of Indian Plate units. Radiometric dating of zircon, titanite and rutile by U-Pb and amphibole and micas by Ar-Ar reveal peak pressure conditions at 47-48 Ma. With a maximum exhumation rate of 14 cm\/a these rocks reached the crust-mantle boundary at 40-35 km within 1 Ma. Subsequent exhumation (46-41 Ma, 40-35 km) decelerated to ca. 1 mm\/a at the base of the continental crust but rose again to about 2 mm\/a in the period of 41-31 Ma, equivalent to 35-20 km. Apatite fission track (AFT) and (U-Th)\/He ages from eclogites, amphibolites, micaschists and gneisses yielded moderate Oligocene to Miocene cooling rates of about 10\u00b0C\/Ma in the high altitude northern parts of the Kaghan Valley using the mineral-pair method. AFT ages are of 24.5\u00b13.8 to 15.6\u00b12.1 Ma whereas apatite (U-Th)\/He analyses yielded ages between 21.0\u00b10.6 and 5.3\u00b10.2 Ma. The southern-most part of the Valley is dominated by younger late Miocene to Pliocene apatite fission track ages of 7.6\u00b12.1 and 4.0\u00b10.5 Ma that support earlier tectonically and petrologically findings of a juxtaposition and stack of Indian Plate units. As this nappe is tectonically lowermost, a later distinct exhumation and uplift driven by thrusting along the Main Boundary Thrust is inferred. Out of this geochemical, petrological, isotope-geochemical and low temperature thermochronology investigations it was concluded that the exhumation was buoyancy driven and caused an initial rapid exhumation: exhumation as fast as recent normal plate movements (ca. 10 cm\/a). As the exhuming units reached the crust-mantle boundary the process slowed down due to changes in buoyancy. Most likely, this exhumation pause has initiated the reheating event that is petrologically evident (e.g. glaucophane rimmed by hornblende, ilmenite overgrowth of rutile). Late stage processes involved widespread thrusting and folding with accompanied regional greenschist facies metamorphism, whereby contemporaneous thrusting on the Batal Thrust (seen sometimes equivalent to the MCT) and back sliding of the Kohistan Arc along the inverse reactivated Main Mantle Thrust caused final exposure of these rocks. Similar circumstances have been seen at Tso Morari, Ladakh, India, 200 km further east where comparable rock assemblages occur. In conclusion, as exhumation was already done well before the initiation of the monsoonal system, climate dependent effects (erosion) appear negligible in comparison to far-field tectonic effects. Thus, the channel flow model is not applicable for this part of the Himalayas.",

The seismic line has a length of 250 km and was the first and only DEKORP line to be acquired using explosives as source energy. The objectives of the experiment were to explore the deep crustal structure of the Saxothuringian Zone and of its transitions into the adjacent Moldanubian and Rhenohercynian Zones of the Variscan Belt, to obtain evidence about vertical tectonic processes during the Variscan orogenesis, to understand the causes of observed gravity and magnetic anomalies and to recognize and define the Variscan front to the north. In addition, the survey contributed to the International Lithosphere Program (ILP) and the former European Geotraverse (EGT). Details of the experiment, preliminary results and interpretations may be obtained from DEKORP Research Group (1985) or Meissner et al. (1987). The Technical Report of line 2S gives complete information about acquisition and processing parameters. The European Variscides, extending from the French Central Massif to the East European Platform, originated during the collision between Gondwana and Baltica in the Late Palaeozoic. Due to involvement of various crustal blocks in the orogenesis, the mountain belt is subdivided into distinct zones. The external fold-and-thrust belts of the Rhenohercynian and Saxothuringian as well as the predominantly crystalline body of the Moldanubian dominate the central European segment of the Variscides. Polyphase tectonic deformation, magmatism and metamorphic processes led to a complex interlinking between the units. The SE-NW striking DEKORP 2S line runs perpendicular to the Variscan strike direction and crosses the tectonic boundaries between the Moldanubian, Saxothuringian and Rhenohercynian units, which are predominantly covered by Permian and younger sediments (DEKORP Research Group, 1985).

        "description": "The 100 km wide M\u00e9rida Andes extend from the Colombian\/Venezuelan border to the Caribbean coast. To the north and south, the M\u00e9rida Andes are bound by hydrocarbon-rich sedimentary basins. This mountain chain and its associated major strike-slip fault systems formed by the oblique convergence of the Caribbean with the South American Plate and the north-eastwards expulsion of the North Andean Block in western Venezuela. In 2013, the Integrated Geoscience of the M\u00e9rida Andes Project (the GIAME project) was initiated to image the M\u00e9rida Andes on a lithospheric scale and to develop a dynamic model of their evolution by integrating wide-angle seismic, magnetotelluric and potential field data. Magnetotelluric (MT) dataset was acquired in 2015 along a 240 km long profile across the M\u00e9rida Andes. MT studies of orogens often reveal complex resistivity structures, typically associated with active deformation and characterized by high electrical conductivity zones. Fluids in fault systems and fluids derived from remineralization reactions of hydrous minerals often characterise high conductivity in active tectonic regimes. Cruces-Zabala et al. (2020) identified conductive zones with up to 10 km depth for the Maracaibo Basin and 5 km for the Barinas - Apure Basin. The M\u00e9rida Andes are charaterized by high resistivity separated by several conductive anomalies that corelate spatialy to the fault systems at the surface. A conductive zone a great depth (&gt;50km) was identified as a projection of the detachment surface of the Trujillo Block to the east. This data publication encompasses a detailed report in pdf format with a description of the project, information on the experimental setup, data collection, instrumentation used, recording configuration and data quality.

        "description": "This data set is Part 2 of the compiles whole-rock chemical data for late-Variscan low-F biotite and two-mica granites in the German Erzgebirge, in the Saxothuringian Zone of the Variscan Orogen. The group of F-poor biotite granites is represented by the composite massifs of Kirchberg and Niederbobritzsch, the Plohn Granite Suite (PGS), the Aue Granite Suite (AGS), and the subsurface granites of Beiersdorf und Bernsbach. For the group of two-mica granites, compositional data for the multi-stage Bergen massif and the granites from Lauter and Schwarzenberg are reported (Figure 1). Crystal-melt fractionation was the dominant process controlling the evolution of bulk composition in the course of massif\/pluton formation. However, metasomatic and hydrothermal processes involving late-stage residual melts and high-T late- to post-magmatic fluids became increasingly more important in highly evolved units and have variably modified the abundances of mobile elements. Interaction with the various metamorphic country rocks and infiltration of meteoric low-T fluids have further disturbed the initial chemical patterns in the endocontact zones and zones influenced by surface weathering. The data set reports whole-rock geochemical analyses for enclaves, granites, aplites, endocontact rocks, and some facial varieties.

The data were collected within the research project LIGHTS (Lightweight Integrated Ground and Airborne Hyperspectral Topological Solutions, http:\/\/lights.univ-lorraine.fr\/) which aims at developing a new exploration process for Li targets combining drone-borne hyperspectral data and field observations. Hyperspectral data were acquired with the HySpex system in a wavelength range of 414 - 2498 nm and are presented in a spectral library. Detailed information about the samples and area of spectral retrieval is presented in the data sheet below. The spectral library presented here expands the collection of spectral libraries including samples from rare-earth minerals, rare-earth-oxides (Koerting et al., 2019a) and copper-bearing minerals (Koellner et al., 2019) which are fully described in Koerting et al. (2021). These libraries aim to give a spectral overview of important resources and deposit mineralizations. 18 samples taken partly from the collections of the University of Potsdam (UP) and the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) and partly in the field during previous measurement campaigns were hyperspectrally measured and geochemically analysed by using a LIBS handheld analyzer. A description of the HySpex system in lab use can be found in Koerting et al. (2021). The lithium-bearing mineral samples were measured without prior sample preparation as the surface of the minerals and the influence of the mineral structure were of interest (Figure 1). Figure 1 shows one HySpex scan of four lepidolite samples (Lep1, Lep2, Lep3, Lep4) displayed as a true color RGB image in order to show the untreated samples and the white reflectance (WR) panel needed for the hyperspectral measurements (WR 90%).",

        "description": "Sampling large river\u00b4s sediment at outlets for cosmogenic nuclide analysis yields mean denudation rates of the sediment producing areas that average local variations in denudation commonly found in small rivers. Using this approach, we measured in situ cosmogenic 26Al and 10Be concentrations in sands of &gt;50 large rivers over a range of climatic and tectonic regimes covering 32% of Earth\u2019s terrestrial surface. River samples were processed in the Helmholtz Laboratory for the Geochemistry of the Earth Surface (HELGES) (von Blanckenburg et al., 2016). 10Be\/9Be ratios were measured by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) at the University of Cologne and normalized to the KN01-6-2 and KN01-5-3 standards. Denudation rates were calculated using a time-dependent scaling scheme according to Lal\/Stone \u201dLm\u201d scaling (see Balco et al., 2008) together with a sea level high latitude (SLHL) production rate of 4.13 at\/(gxyr) as reported by Martin et al. (2017). Measured in the mineral quartz, the cosmogenic nuclides 26Al and 10Be provide information on how fast Earth\u00b4s surface is lowering through denudation. If sediment is however stored in catchments over time spans similar to the nuclides half-lives (being 0.7 Myr and 1.4 Myr for 26Al and 10Be, respectively), the nuclide\u00b4s budget is disturbed, and meaningful denudation rates cannot be calculated. The ratio of 26Al\/10Be informs us about these disturbances. In 35% of analyzed rivers, we find 26Al\/10Be ratios significantly lower than these nuclides\u00b4 surface production rate ratio of 6.75 in quartz, indicating sediment storage and burial exceeding 0.5 Myr. We invoke mainly a combination of slow erosion, long transport, and low runoff for these low ratios. In the other 65% of rivers we find 26Al\/10Be ratios within uncertainty of their surface production-rate ratio, indicating cosmogenic steady state, and hence meaningful denudation rates can be calculated. For these rivers, we derive a global source-area denudation rate of 140 t\/km^2\/yr that translates to a flux of 3.10 Gt\/yr. By assuming that this sub-dataset is geomorphically representative of the global land surface, we upscale this value to the total surface area for exorheic basins, thereby obtaining a global denudation flux from cosmogenic nuclides of 15.1 Gt\/yr that integrates over the past 5 kyr. In Table S1, we provide detailed 10Be nuclide production rates and their correction due to ice shielding and carbonates that are necessary to calculate denudation rates. We provide International GeoSample Numbers (ISGN) for samples used in the analysis, except values that were compiled from published sources. We then compare these denudation rates, converted to sediment fluxes, to published values of sediment fluxes from river load gauging. We find that our cosmogenic nuclide-derived sediment flux value is similar, within uncertainty, to published values from cosmogenic nuclides from small river basins (23 Gt\/yr) upscaled using a global slope model, and modern sediment and dissolved loads exported to the oceans (23.6 Gt\/yr). In Table S3, we compiled these modern sediment loads and give their references. We also compiled runoff values (mm\/yr) from published sources (Table S2) that are used to infer what controls denudation rates.

        "description": "The southern Central Andes (SCA, 29\u00b0S-39\u00b0S) are characterized by the subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate beneath the continental South American Plate. One striking feature of this area is the change of the subduction angle of the Nazca Plate between 33\u00b0S and 35\u00b0S from the Chilean-Pampean flat-slab zone (&lt; 5\u00b0 dip) in the north to a steeper sector in the south (~30\u00b0 dip). Subduction geometry, tectonic deformation, and seismicity at this plate boundary are closely related to the lithospheric strength in the upper plate. Despite recent research focused on the compositional and thermal characteristics of the SCA lithosphere, the lithospheric strength distribution remains largely unknown. Here we calculated the long-term lithospheric strength on the basis of an existing 3D model describing the variation of thickness, density and temperature of geological units forming the lithosphere of the SCA. The model consists of a continental plate with sediments, a two-layer crust and the lithospheric mantle being subducted by an oceanic plate. The model extension covers an area of 700 km x 1100 km, including the orogen (i.e. magmatic arc, main orogenic wedge), the forearc and the foreland, and it extents down to 200 km depth.",

        "title": "Isotopic data of pyrite (\u03b434S) and barite (\u03b434S, \u03b418O) in the Canol Formation (Selwyn Basin, Canada)",
        "description": "The stable isotopic composition of pyrite (\u03b434Spyrite) and barite (\u03b434Sbarite, \u03b418Obarite) in marine sedimentary rocks provides a valuable archive for reconstructing the biogeochemical processes that link the sulfur, carbon, and iron cycles. Highly positive \u03b434Spyrite values that exceed coeval unmodified seawater sulfate (\u03b434Spyrite &gt; \u03b434SSO4(SW)), have been recorded in both modern sediments and ancient sedimentary records and are interpreted to result from various biotic and abiotic processes under a range of environmental conditions. A host of processes, including basin restriction, euxinia, low seawater sulfate, dissimilatory microbial sulfate reduction, sulfide reoxidation, and sulfur disproportionation, have been suggested to account for the formation of highly positive \u03b434Spyrite values in marine environments. Significantly, determining which of these factors was responsible for the pyrite formation is impeded by a lack of constraints for coeval sulfate, with relatively few examples available where \u03b434Spyrite and proxies for \u03b434Ssulfate values (e.g., barite) have been paired at high resolution. In the Selwyn Basin, Canada, the Late Devonian sedimentary system is host to large, mudstone-hosted bedded barite units. These barite units have been interpreted in the past as distal expressions of SEDEX mineralization. However, recent studies on similar settings have highlighted how barite may have formed by diagenetic processes before being subsequently replaced during hydrothermal sulfide mineralization. Coincidentally, highly positive \u03b434Sbarite values have been recorded in such barite occurring coevally with pyrite in diagenetic redox front, where sulfate reduction is coupled to anaerobic oxidation of methane (SR-AOM) at the sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ). The mechanisms of sulfur cycling and concurrent processes are, nevertheless, poorly constrained. Grema et al. (2021) integrate high-resolution scanning electron microscopy petrography of barite (+ associated barium phases) and pyrite, together with microscale isotopic microanalyses of \u03b434Spyrite, \u03b434Sbarite, and \u03b418Obarite of selected samples from the Late Devonian Canol Formation of the Selwyn Basin. Samples containing both barite and pyrite were targeted to develop paired isotopic constraints on the evolution of sulfur during diagenesis. We have focused on the precise mechanism by which highly positive \u03b434Spyrite values developed in the Canol Formation and discuss the implications for interpreting sulfur isotopes in similar settings. This data report comprises microscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analyses of the isotopic compositions of pyrite (\u03b434Spyrite; n= 200) and barite (\u03b434Sbarite; n= 485, \u03b418Obarite; n= 338) in nine stratigraphic sections of the Northwest Territories\u2019 part of the Selwyn Basin. Microdrills of regions of interest (n= 54) were made on polished sections to obtain suitable subsamples, using a 4 mm diameter diamond core drill. Several representative subsamples were cast into 25 mm epoxy pucks, together with reference materials (RMs) of pyrite S0302A (\u03b434S V-CDT = 0.0 \u00b1 0.2\u2030 (Liseroudi et al., 2021)) and barite S0327 (\u03b434SV-CDT = 11.0 \u00b1 0.5 \u2030; \u03b418OV-SMOW = 21.3 \u00b1 0.2 \u2030 (Magnall et al., 2016)). Microscale isotopic analyses were carried out using Cameca IMS1280 large-geometry secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) operated in multi-collector mode at the NordSIMS laboratory, Stockholm, Sweden. External analytical reproducibility (1 \u03c3) was typically \u00b1 0.04\u2030 \u03b434S for pyrite, \u00b1 0.15\u2030 \u03b434S, and \u00b1 0.12\u2030 \u03b418O for barite.

Although glacier ice algae cause up to 13% of the surface melting in this region, the controls on bloom development remain poorly understood. Here we show a direct link between mineral phosphorus in surface ice and glacier ice algae biomass through the quantification of solid and fluid phase phosphorus reservoirs in surface habitats across the southwest ablation zone of the ice sheet.

        "description": "This data set is Part 9 of a series of data sets dealing with the composition of accessory minerals from felsic igneous rocks compiles chemical data for monazite-(Ce), xenotime-(Y) and zircon from several, late-Variscan granite occurrences in the Aue-Schwarzenberg Granite Zone (ASGZ) located in the Western Erzgebirge\u2212Vogtland metallogenic province of Germany. The rocks treated in this data set encompass the biotite granites of the Aue suite, Bernsbach and Beierfeld, and the two-mica granites from Lauter and the Schwarzenberg suite. The data set contains the complete pile of electron-microprobe analyses for monazite-(Ce) (MONA-ASGZ-2021), xenotime-(Y) (XENO-ASGZ-2021) and zircon (ZIRC-ASGZ-2021). Tables are presented as Excel (xlsx) resp. machine-readable csv formats. The content of the tables and further information on the granites and regional geology are provided in the data description file and the supplementary literature. The ASGZ (about 325 Ma) is located within the deep-reaching Gera-J\u00e1chymov Fault Zone and includes the F-poor biotite granites of the Aue suite (including the granite occurrences at Schlema-Alberoda, Aue, Auerhammer, and Schneeberg), Bernsbach and Beierfeld, and the F-poor two-mica granites of the Schwarzenberg suite (covering the granite occurrences at Schwarzenberg, Neuwelt, and Erla) and Lauter (Fig. 1). The granite encountered by drilling at the village Burkersdorf does not represent an independent intrusion, but is instead a subsurface exposure of the westerly Kirchberg granite, at the contact to the metamorphic country rock. The petrography, mineralogy, geochemistry, isotopic composition, and geochronology of the ASGZ rocks have been comprehensively described by F\u00f6rster et al. (2009). The paper of F\u00f6rster (2010) reports a selection of results of electron-microprobe analyses of monazite-(Ce), xenotime-(Y) and zircon, but the bulk of the obtained data remained unpublished. This paper also provides a mineralogical mass-balance calculation for the lanthanides and actinides of the Aue and Schwarzenberg granite suites and a selection of back-scattered electron images displaying the intergrowths, texture, and alteration patterns of the radioactive and REE-Y-Zr-bearing accessory species. The F-poor biotite granites of the ASGZ are weakly to mildly peraluminous (A\/CNK = 1.07 \u2013 1.14; SiO2 = 70 \u2013 76 wt.%). The F-poor two-mica granites are mildly to strongly peraluminous (A\/CNK = 1.17 \u2013 1.26) and cover a similar range in silica concentration (69 \u2013 77 wt%). From this granite group, only more fractionated, higher evolved sub-intrusions were subjected to the study of accessory-mineral composition. Some granites of this zone are genetically related with ortho-magmatic W-Mo veins and para-magmatic vein-type U mineralization.",

The drilling campaign in the semi-arid field site Reserve Santa Gracia was conducted in the framework of the \u201cEarthShape\u201d project (DFG SPP1803) to study deep weathering along a climate gradient. Previous studies in this area found that the weathering front is located much deeper than expected (Oeser et al., 2018). To explore the weathering profile and the depth of the weathering front, we performed various geochemical, petrophysical, and mineralogical analyses. The drilling campaign was conducted in March and April 2019, using the wireline drilling method with a standard industry truck-mounted PQ3-sized (85 mm core diameter, 123 mm hole diameter) rotary drilling rig (Sondajes Araos E.I.R.L.). A detailed description of the drilling activities is given in Krone et al. (2021). The retrieved core runs with a maximum length of 1.5 m were drilled using potable water, with added contamination control tracer for further microbiological analyses of the rock. As basis for our detailed study of deep weathering we determined the porosity, density, specific surface area, elemental composition, mineralogical composition, Fe oxidation, and the degree of weathering from chemical depletion, volumetric strain, and the weathering rate using the in situ cosmogenic nuclide beryllium-10 (10Be).",

        "description": "Analyzing the chemical composition of rocks and minerals is an important tool for exploring and understanding mineral resources. Typically, hydrothermal ore deposits are characterized by primary alteration halos. At the world-class Panasqueira W-Sn-Cu deposit, the hydrothermal alteration of the wall rocks produced concentric zones with progressively greater distance from the veins, consisting of a proximal tourmaline-quartz-muscovite zone and a distal muscovite-quartz zone. Tourmaline and mica are ubiquitous minerals at Panasqueira W-Sn-Cu and coexist in many other hydrothermal ore deposits worldwide. Both minerals are well-known to host variable amounts of trace elements and to have potential as pathfinder minerals as well as fluid monitors. We analyzed major, minor and trace element contents of altered and unaltered metasediments from the Panasqueira by XRF and ICP-MS and tourmaline and white mica major, minor and trace element compositions by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) in previously well-characterized samples from different locations\/setting in the mine (greisen, vein-selvages, wall-rock alteration zones, fault zone, and late vugs).

        "description": "Faults and fractures form the largest contrast of fluid flow in the subsurface, while their permeability is highly affected by effective pressure changes. In this experimental study, fractured low-permeability Flechtingen (Rotliegend) sandstones were cyclically loaded in a MTS tri-axial compression cell. Two different loading scenarios were considered: \u201ccontinuous cyclic loading\u201d (CCL) and \u201cprogressive cyclic loading\u201d (PCL). During continuous cyclic loading, a displaced tensile fracture was loaded hydrostatically from 2 to 60 MPa in several repeated cycles. During progressive cyclic loading, the load was increased with a step-wise function (15, 30, 45 and 60 MPa) and unloaded after every loading step. For full elasticity of rock matrix deformation each rock sample has been preconditioned up to 65 MPa. After that, an artificial tensile fracture was introduced into the sample using the Brazilian Disk test. The fractured sample was installed into the MTS triaxial cell at a given offset of 0.5 mm and hydrostatic loading was applied accordingly. The fracture permeability was measured continuously using the cubic law calculated from the hydraulic aperture. Fracture closure was measured using LVDT extensometers during the entire experiment and the resulting fracture closure and stiffness was calculated accordingly. The total deformation of the sample was corrected by the amount of elastic deformation of the rock matrix to obtain the fracture closure only. Potential changes to the fracture surface topography before and after the experiments were analysed from high-resolution surface scans obtained by a 3D profilometer using the fringe pattern projection. The scale-independent roughness exponent was calculated using power spectral density method assuming self-affinity. The fracture aperture distribution and contact-area ratio was calculated by matching the best fitting principal planes of the bottom and top surface and applying a grid search algorithm. The results showed a \u201cstress-memory\u201d effect of fracture stiffness during progressive loading that can be used to identify previous stress states in fractures. This effect is characterized by a transition from a non-linear to a linear (reversible to non-reversible) behaviour of specific fracture stiffness when a previous stress-maximum is exceeded. Furthermore, the evolution of fracture permeability shows less reduction during progressive cyclic loading compared to continuous cyclic loading. The data measured during the flow-through experiment under varying effective pressure are provided in the file \u201cMTS_data.zip\u201d. The data are provided as separate text-files as well as in Excel format with different spreadsheets, such that each figure in the paper can be recalculated and that the underlying data is comprehensive. The name of all three rock samples is given in the file name including the type of the experiment (CCL or PCL). The fracture surfaces and the fracture aperture distributions are found within the file \u201cSurface_data.zip\u201d.

        "description": "These datasets were used to evaluate the main controls on last ~6 million years erosion rate variability of the northwestern Himalaya. The Earth\u2019s climate has been cooling during the last ~15 million years and started fluctuating between cold and warm periods since ~2-3 million years ago. Many researchers think that these long-term climatic changes were accompanied by changes in continental erosion. However, quantifying erosion rates in the geological past is challenging, and previous studies reached contrasting conclusions. In this study, we quantified erosion rates in the north-western Indian Himalaya over the past 6 million years by measuring in situ-produced cosmogenic 10Be in exhumed older foreland basin sediments. The 10Be is produced by cosmic rays in minerals at the Earth's surface, and its abundance indicates erosion rates. Our reconstructed erosion rates show a quasi-cyclic pattern with a periodicity of ~1 million year and a gradual increase towards the present. We suggest that both patterns\u2014cyclicity and gradual increase\u2014are unrelated to climatic changes. Instead, we propose that the growth of the Himalaya by repeatedly scraping off rocks from the Indian plate (basal accretion), resulted in changes of its topography that were accompanied by changes in erosion rates. In this scenario, basal accretion episodically changes rock-uplift patterns, which brings landscapes out of equilibrium and results in quasi-cyclic variations in erosion rates. We used numerical landscape evolution simulations to demonstrate that this hypothesis is physically plausible. Datasets provided here includes summary of the location, depositional age, and stratigraphic position of 41 Siwalik sandstone samples collected from the Haripur section in Himachal Pradesh, India (Dataset S1); 10Be analysis results of Siwalik samples (2021-006_Mandal-et-al_Dataset-S1); sample location and 10Be analysis results of modern river sands from the Yamuna River and its tributaries near the Dehradun Basin (2021-006_Mandal-et-al_Dataset-S2); input parameters for the calculation of paleoerosion rates (2021-006_Mandal-et-al_Dataset-S3); and reconstructed 10Be paleoconcentrations and paleoerosion rates (Dataset S4). Moreover, the data include a compilation of published magnetostratigraphy-derived sediment accumulation rates in the late Cenozoic Himalayan foreland basin (2021-006_Mandal-et-al_Dataset-S5). We also include a movie (2021-006_Mandal-et-al_Movie-S1) that is a complete numerical landscape evolution model run with four consecutive accretion cycles of equal magnitude.

Listed are data from the massifs\/plutons of Eibenstock in the western Erzgebirge and Annaberg, Geyer, Pobershau, and Seiffen in the central Erzgebirge (Figure 1). All these occurrences represent composite bodies made-up of texturally and geochemically distinct, but cogenetic sub-intrusions, which are associated with intra- und perigranitic aplitic dykes, pegmatitic schlieren, and frequently mineralized quartz veins and greisens (Tables 1-3). These granites exhibit moderately to strongly elevated concentrations of P, F, Li, Rb, Cs, Ta, Sn, W and U, but are low to very low in Ti, Mg, V, Sc, Co, Ni, Sr, Ba, Y, Zr, Hf, Th, and the REEs. Crystal-melt fractionation was the dominant process controlling the evolution of bulk composition in the course of massif\/pluton formation. However, metasomatic processes involving late-stage residual melts and high-T late- to postmagmatic fluids became increasingly more important in highly evolved units and have variably modified the abundances of mobile elements (P, F, Li, Rb, Cs, Ba, Sr). Interaction with the various country rocks and infiltration of meteoric low-T fluids have further disturbed the initial chemical patterns. The data set reports whole-rock geochemical analyses for granites, aplites, and endocontact rocks obtained for the massifs\/plutons of Eibenstock, Pobershau, Satzung, Annaberg, and Geyer. Data are provided as separate excel and csv files. The content of the excel sheet and further information on the granites and regional geology are provided in the data description file.",

        "description": "The qualitative and quantitative phase analyses were performed in the KTB field laboratory by x-ray powder diffraction using SIEMENS D 500 diffractometer. During early stages of the KTB project a new method for quantitative phase analysis was developed (see references below). The method is based on the comparison of the diffraction spectrum of the unknown sample with those of pure minerals. The powder diffraction data of the minerals are stored in a database built up of 250 natural minerals separated from various types of igneous and metamorphic rocks. The complete analyses (radiation: Cu K alpha, lambda: 1,5405\u00c5, stepwidth: 0,01\u00b0, counting time 2 sec\/step, angle 2-80\u00b0) was carried out automatically including computations. The results of this quantitative phase analysis were used e.g. to check thin section petrography (and vice versa) and to construct a \\\"mineralogical rock composition log\\\".",

        "title": "A global database of radiogenic Nd and Sr isotopes in marine and terrestrial samples (V. 3.0)",
        "description": "The database presented here contains radiogenic neodymium and strontium isotope ratios measured on both terrestrial and marine sediments. It was compiled to help assessing sediment provenance and transport processes for various time intervals. This can be achieved by either mapping sediment isotopic signature and\/or fingerprinting source areas using statistical tools (e.g. Blanchet, 2018b, 2018a). The database has been built by incorporating data from the literature and various databases and data compilations, and harmonizing the metadata, especially units and geographical coordinates. The original data were processed in three steps. Firstly, a specific attention has been devoted to provide geographical coordinates to each sample in order to be able to map the data. When available, the original geographical coordinates from the reference (generally DMS coordinates, with different precision standard) were transferred into the decimal degrees system. When coordinates were not provided, an approximate location was derived from available information in the original publication. Secondly, all samples were assigned a set of standardized criteria that help splitting the dataset in specific categories. We defined categories associated with the sample location, the type of sample, the sedimentary fraction measured, or the deposition age (as given in the original publication). This dataset consists of one spreadsheet: \"Dataset_Nd_Sr_isotopes_V3.txt\", which contains the assembled dataset of marine and terrestrial Nd and\/or Sr concentration and isotopes, together with sorting criteria and geographical locations. A full reference list is provided in the file \u201cReferences_Database_Nd_Sr_isotopes_V3.pdf\u201d. R code for mapping the data and running statistical analyses is also available for this dataset (Blanchet, 2018b, 2018a).",

        "title": "Mechanical test data of quartz sand, garnet sand, gypsum powder (plaster), kaolin and sand-plaster mixtures used as granular analogue materials in geoscience laboratory experiments",
        "description": "This dataset provides mechanical test data for quartz sand (\u201cMAM1ST-300\u201d, Sibelco, Mol, Belgium), gypsum powder (plaster; \u201cGoldband\u201d, Knauf), kaolin clay powder, garnet sand, and mixtures of quartz sand and gypsum powder, used at the Analogue Laboratory of the Department of Geography at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium, for simulating brittle rocks in the upper crust (Poppe et al., 2019). The measured properties are density \u03c1, tensile strength T0, shear strength \u03c3, obtained by density measurements, ring-shear tests (RST; at Helmholtz Centre Potsdam GFZ, Germany), direct shear tests, traction tests (at University of Maine, Le Mans, France) and extension tests. The obtained tensile strengths and shear strengths reconstruct two-dimensional failure envelopes for each material. By fitting linear Coulomb and non-linear combined Griffith failure criteria to the characterised failure envelopes (Jaeger et al., 2007), the internal friction coefficient \u00b5C, Coulomb cohesion CC and Griffith cohesion CG are obtained. The influence of the material emplacement technique has been investigated in Poppe et al. (2021) to which this data set is supplementary, by repeat characterisation of the above physical parameters under three emplacement conditions, i.e. sieving, pouring (non-dried state) and compaction after pouring (oven-dried state). We find that densities of the materials and mixtures range from ~1600 kg.m\u00b3 (sieved) and ~1700 kg.m\u00b3 (compacted) for pure quartz sand to ~600 kg.m\u00b3 (poured) to ~900 kg.m\u00b3 (compacted) for pure plaster. Tensile strengths range from ~166 Pa (sand) to ~425 Pa (plaster). Velocity ring-shear tests on a 90 wt% quartz sand \u2013 10 wt% plaster mixture show a minor shear rate-weakening of &lt;2% per ten-fold increase in shear velocity. The materials show a behavior ranging from Mohr-Coulomb behavior for the materials with coarser grain size (sands) to combined Griffith-Mohr-Coulomb behavior for the powder materials (plaster, kaolin), with the sand-plaster mixtures occupying a spectrum between both end-members. Peak friction coefficients range from ~0.5 (sand) to ~0.6 (plaster) with a maximum of ~0.9 (80:20 wt% sand:plaster), peak Coulomb cohesions range from 13 Pa (sand) to 248 Pa (plaster), peak Griffith cohesions range from ~10 Pa (sand) to ~425 Pa (plaster).",

        "description": "Carbonate minerals are ubiquitous in most sediment-hosted mineral deposits. These deposits can contain a variety of carbonate types with complex paragenetic relationships. When normalized to chondritic values (CN), rare-earth elements and yttrium (REE+YCN) can be used to constrain fluid chemistry and fluid-rock interaction processes in both low- and high-temperature settings. Unlike other phases (e.g., pyrite), the application of in situ laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (LA-ICP-MS) data to the differentiation of pre-ore and hydrothermal carbonates remains relatively untested. To assess the potential applicability of carbonate in situ REE+Y data, we combined transmitted light and cathodoluminescence (CL) petrography with LA-ICP-MS analysis of carbonate mineral phases from (1) the Proterozoic George Fisher clastic dominated (CD-type) massive sulfide deposit and from (2) correlative, barren host rock lithologies (Urquhart Shale Formation). The REE+YCN composition of pre-ore calcite suggests it formed during diagenesis from diagenetic pore fluids derived from ferruginous, anoxic seawater. Hydrothermal and hydrothermally altered calcite and dolomite from George Fisher is generally more LREE depleted than the pre-ore calcite, whole-rock REE concentrations, and shale reference values. We suggest this is the result of hydrothermal alteration by saline Cl--rich mineralizing fluids. Furthermore, the presence of both positive and negative Eu\/Eu* values in calcite and dolomite indicates that the mineralizing fluids were relatively hot (&gt;250\u00b0C) and cooled below 200-250\u00b0C during ore formation. This study confirms the hypothesis that in situ REE+Y data can be used to differentiate between pre-ore and hydrothermal carbonate and provide important constraints on the conditions of ore formation.",

        "description": "We investigate the anisotropic nature of the mantle in a part of the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone where several of the constituent tectonic blocks of Iran come into contact. Our aim is to identify the dominant source of anisotropy in order to infer the pattern of mantle deformation as it responds to the forces of continental convergence. The broadband seismic data used in this study were recorded by 68 seismic stations in three temporary arrays in NW Iran (between 45\u00ba00'E - 51\u00ba00'E and 35\u00ba00'N - 39\u00ba00'N) installed and operated non-concurrently between 2008 and 2016 by the Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences (IASBS) and the University of Cambridge, and one permanent station of the Iranian National Seismic Network (INSN). The stations were repositioned during deployment and the recording span at individual stations varied between 4 and 31 months. The temporary arrays were mainly linear profiles that traversed the Talesh and western Alborz Mountains, NW Iran, and parts of the central Iran Plateau to the vicinity of the UDMA. Our dataset includes seismic records of S and SK(K)S phases. For the SK(K)S splitting measurements we used teleseismic earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 5.5 and epicentral distances between 90\u00ba and 130\u00ba, and for the direct S phase analysis we considered events larger than magnitude 5.5 in the distance range of 40\u00ba to 80\u00ba.",

These deposits are mostly hosted primarily in dolomitic silt- and mudstones. The hydrothermal alteration footprint of these CD-type systems is not well constrained, which poses challenges for the targeting of future discoveries. One important aspect to developing alteration models relates to defining the composition of the unaltered protolith to mineralization. In this dataset, we provide whole rock lithogeocheochemical data generated from samples obtained from drill-holes that intersected the mineralization in the Teena subbasin. A small number of samples are from 2 drill-holes from an adjoining subbasin (Myrtle) in the area. The samples were selected from stratigraphy of the Barney Creek Formation and are from the hangingwall to the mineralization in either subbasin. This data report includes bulk rock major, minor, and trace element composition. The data were generated using X-ray fluorescence, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and LECO analyses.

        "description": "The Proterozoic Carpentaria province in northern Australia comprises several of the wordl's largest Zn-Pb massive sulphide deposits. These deposits are mostly hosted in fine grained siliciclastic sedimentary rocks, which have been affected by variable degrees of tectonic overprint, especially to the south of the district. Three of these world class clastic-dominated (CD-type) Zn-Pb deposits (George Fisher, Hilton, and Mount Isa) are hosted in siltstones and mudstones of the Urquhart Shale Formation (ca. 1654 Ma; southern Carpentaria Province). The hydrothermal alteration footprint of these CD-type systems is not well constrained, which complicates exploration for and discovery of new CD-type Zn-Pb deposits. A major caveat to understanding such footprints is the availability of suitable correlative host rock lithologies, which represent the un-mineralized protolith (background composition). In this study, we report whole rock lithogeocheochemical and mineralogical data from drill-holes that intersected the main ore bodies at the George Fisher deposit and from correlative un-mineralized Urquhart Shale. These data were combined with petrographic observations in order to (1) establish the detrital, authigenic, and diagenetic background composition of the Paleoproterozoic Urquhart Shale Formation, and to (2) evaluate mineralogical and associated chemical mass changes that resulted from the hydrothermal event(s) at the George Fisher deposit. This data report includes bulk rock major, minor, and trace element composition, as well as S, TOC, total C, CO2, Cgra concentrations, and mineralogical composition of 41 samples from the un-mineralized Urquhart Shale Formation and 70 samples from the George Fisher deposit.

        "description": "This data set is the part 8 of a series reporting chemical data for accessory minerals from felsic igneous rocks. Compositional data were acquired by electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA) between about 1995 and 2005 on surface rocks and borehole samples. This data set assembles the results of EPMA of fluorapatite from felsic rocks representing three groups of granites in the Erzgebirge\u2212Vogtland metallogenic province of Germany emplaced in the late Carboniferous: F-poor biotite granites, F-poor two-mica granites, and P-F-rich Li-mica granite. In these rocks, fluorapatite is typically omnipresent. It has to be noted that apatite has not yet been in the focus of mineralogical studies of the granites in this province and a comprehensive survey of its compositional signature and variability in space and time is still pending. However, the data listed in this data set provide a valuable glimpse into the similarities and differences in apatite chemistry between geochemically distinct felsic rocks, and into the evolution in composition from early to late crystallizing apatite populations. The data underpin that apatite is a sensitive monitor of the compositional properties of the media (melts and fluids) from which it was deposited or with which it interacted. Apatite from the studied rocks is basically fluorapatite with little or no Cl and OH detected respectively inferred. Elemental variations are observed at various scales, i.e., between granite groups, subsequently crystallized sub-intrusion within composite massifs, grains present in a single thin section, or between the center and the rim of a particular grain. These variations in particular refer to the following elements: Mn, Fe, Na, and the rare-earth elements (REE). For example, measured Mn concentrations range from 0.15 to 8.8 wt% MnO. The data set contains the complete pile of electron-microprobe analyses for fluorapatite (APAT-ERZ-2020). The data are presented as Excel (xlsx) and tab-delimited text (txt) formats.

        "description": "This data set is the second part of a series reporting chemical data for accessory minerals from felsic igneous rocks. Most data refer to plutonic rocks from the Saxothuringian Zone of the Variscan Orogen (Erzgebirge\u2212Vogtland metallogenic province) in Germany performed between about 1995 and 2005 on surface rocks and borehole samples. \n      This data set assembles the results of electron-microprobe spot analyses of monazite-(Ce), xenotime-(Y) and zircon from the Li-mica granite massif of Eibenstock. This massif is composed of several, compositionally and texturally distinct sub-intrusions. Least evolved members of the fractionation series are exposed as variably sized enclaves. The pluton is cross-cut by fine-grained aplitic dikes. These late-Variscan (c. 318\u2212320 Ma) granites are highly evolved, rich in Si (72.4-75.8 wt% SiO2), F, P, Li, Rb, Cs, and Sn, mildly to strongly peraluminous (A\/CNK = 1.14\u22121.35), of transitional S\u2212I-type affinity, and spatially and genetically associated with coeval significant Sn\u2212W\u2212(Mo) mineralization. \n      Most notably, a comparatively large population of grains of all three species is distinguished by abnormal composition, reflecting the chemically evolved nature of their hosts. Probe data indicate that the composition of monazite-(Ce) and zircon changes with fractionation-driven evolution of magma chemistry. Monazite-(Ce) composition extends over an abnormally large range. In the course of magma differentiation, mineral chemistry evolves towards enrichment Th and U and development of flattened and kinked chondrite-normalized LREE patterns, with negative anomalies at La or Nd, or both (also known as lanthanide tetrad effect). Many grains are so rich in Th that they classify as cheralite-(Ce). The concentrations (in oxide wt%) of the radionuclides Th and U maximizes to 51.7 and 5.3, respectively. The maximum concentration of Y amounts to 4.7 wt% Y2O3. Composition of zircon displays a large variability. A greater number of grains or domains are distinguished by abnormal enrichment in (in oxide wt%) P (up to 9.6), Th (up to 12.2), U (up to 8.7), Hf (up to 5.6) Al (up to 2.2), Sc (up to 2.0), Y (up to 7.0), HREE and Y. Enrichment in these elements is usually associated with low analytical totals, reflecting precipitation from volatile-rich magmas and\/or their interaction with, and alteration by, late-magmatic fluids. Xenotime-(Y) chemistry is comparatively little sensitive to changes of Eibenstock-magma composition relative to what has been observed for monazite-(Ce) and zircon. The U concentrations in xenotime-(Y) are generally high and maximize to 6.7 wt% UO2. Chondrite-normalized MREE and HREE patterns preferentially in xenotime-(Y) from more evolved magma batches mimic that of their host granites in that they are (a) inclined from Tb-Dy towards Lu, (b) partially evolved the lanthanide tetrad effect, and (c) display above-CHARAC Y\/Ho ratios up to 41.  \n      The data set published here contains the complete pile of data acquired for these three accessory minerals.

        "description": "This data set is the 4th contribution of a series reporting chemical data for accessory minerals from felsic igneous rocks. It deals with two late Variscan biotite-granite massifs emplaced in the Saxothuringian Zone of the Variscan Orogen (Erzgebirge\u2212Vogtland metallogenic province) in Germany. Mineral compositions were measured by electron-microprobe on surface rocks and borehole samples.\n      The data set assembles the results of electron-microprobe spot analyses of primary and secondary allanite-(Ce), monazite-(Ce), xenotime-(Y) and zircon from the multi-phase biotite-granite plutons of Kirchberg (KIB, Western Erzgebirge) and Niederbobritzsch (NBZ, Eastern Erzgebirge). Both plutons comprise several, compositionally and texturally distinct sub-intrusions, contain locally centimeter- to decimeter-sized co-genetic enclaves and xenoliths, and are cross-cut by chemically distinct, fine-grained aplitic dikes. These late-Variscan (c. 325 Ma) granites are moderately to highly evolved and (not considering enclaves) span the SiO2-range (in wt%) 67.0-77.4 (KIB) and 66.8-76.2 (NBZ). The granites are weakly peraluminous (A\/CNK = 1.04\u22121.11 for KIB and 0.99-1.10 for NBZ) and of transitional I\u2212S-type affinity.\n      Formation of primary allanite-(Ce) was restricted to the least-evolved subintrusions KIB1 and NBZ1 of both massifs. All other granites contain monazite-(Ce) as predominant LREE host. Magmatic allanite-(Ce) is variably altered and characterized by totals &lt;100 wt%, implying the presence of several wt% water in the structure. Synchysite-(Ce) constitutes one of its alteration minerals. The Kirchberg massif hosts a second sub-facies of KIB1 that contains monazite instead of allanite as primary species. Severe alteration of this granite facies gave rise to partial or complete dissolution of part of the monazite accompanied by formation of allanite-epidote solid solutions as alteration product. Monazite-(Ce) displays large variations in Th versus REE concentrations even at thin-section scale. Incorporation of Th is mainly governed by the huttonite substitution Th^4+ + Si^4+ = REE^3+ + P^5+. Thorium concentrations span the range 1.33 \u2013 41.8 wt.% ThO2. Xenotime-(Y) does not occur in KBI1 and NBZ1, but crystallized in all other subintrusions. Notable is the predominance of the heaviest REE Er-Lu (normalized to chondrite).\n      The data set contains the complete pile of electron-microprobe analyses for the four accessory minerals allanite-(Ce) (ALLA-KIB-NBZ2019), monazite-(Ce) (MONA-KIB-NBZ2019), xenotime-(Y) (XENO-KIB-NBZ2019) and zircon (ZIRC-KIB-NBZ2019).

The granites form an older, Namurian intrusive complex (OIC-p and OIC-e) and a younger, post-Westphalian intrusive complex (YIC-1 and YIC-2). Both complexes have distinct radioactive accessory-mineral assemblages and compositions. The OIC-p biotite monzogranites contain monazite-(Ce) and minor thorite, but apparently lack magmatic xenotime-(Y) and uraninite.

This publication here provides a hierarchical interlinked stratigraphic classification according to the chronostratigraphical units of the international chronostratigraphic chart of the IUGS v2016\/04 (Cohen et al. 2013, updated) according to international standardisation. As addition to this IUGS chart, which is also documented in GeoSciML, stratigraphic IDs and parent IDs were included to define the direct relationships between the stratigraphic terms. The P\u00b3 database aims at providing easily accessible, peer-reviewed information on physical rock properties relevant for geothermal exploration and reservoir characterization in one single compilation. Collected data include hydraulic, thermophysical and mechanical properties and, in addition, electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility. Each measured value is complemented by relevant meta-information such as the corresponding sample location, petrographic description, chronostratigraphic age and, most important, original citation. The original stratigraphic and petrographic descriptions are transferred to standardized catalogues following a hierarchical structure ensuring intercomparability for statistical analysis, of which the stratigraphic catalogue is presented here. These chronostratigraphic units are compiled to ensure that formations of a certain age are connected to the corresponding stratigraphic epoch, period or erathem. Thus, the chronostratigraphic units are directly correlated to each other by their stratigraphic ID and stratigraphic parent ID and can thus be used for interlinked data assessment of the petrophysical properties of samples of an according stratigraphic unit.",

        "description": "Petrophysical properties are key to populate numerical models of subsurface process simulations and for the interpretation of many geophysical exploration methods. They are characteristic for specific rock types and may vary considerably as a response to subsurface conditions (e.g. temperature and pressure). Hence, the quality of process simulations and geophysical data interpretation critically depend on the knowledge of in-situ physical properties that have been measured for a specific rock unit. Inquiries for rock property values for a specific site might become a very time-consuming challenge given that such data are (1) spread across diverse publications and compilations, (2) heterogeneous in quality and (3) continuously being acquired in different laboratories worldwide. One important quality factor for the usability of measured petrophysical properties is the availability of corresponding metadata such as the sample location, petrography, stratigraphy, or the measuring method, conditions and authorship. The open-access database presented here aims at providing easily accessible, peer-reviewed information on physical rock properties in one single compilation. As it has been developed within the scope of the EC funded project IMAGE (Integrated Methods for Advanced Geothermal Exploration, EU grant agreement No. 608553), the database mainly contains information relevant for geothermal exploration and reservoir characterization, namely hydraulic, thermophysical and mechanical properties and, in addition, electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility. The uniqueness of this database emerges from its coverage and metadata structure. Each measured value is complemented by the corresponding sample location, petrographic description, chronostratigraphic age and original citation. The original stratigraphic and petrographic descriptions are transferred to standardized catalogues following a hierarchical structure ensuring intercomparability for statistical analysis. In addition, information on the experimental set-up (methods) and the measurement conditions are given for quality control. Thus, rock properties can directly be related to in-situ conditions to derive specific parameters relevant for modelling the subsurface or interpreting geophysical data.",

This publication here provides a hierarchical interlinked petrographic classification according to standardized and internationally defined petrographic terms. The petrography or rock type classification scheme is structured based on a hierarchical subdivision with nine different ranks, where the rock description generally becomes more detailed with increasing rank of petrographic classification (based on the well database of the Geological Survey of Hessen, Germany: Hessisches Landesamt f\u00fcr Umwelt, Naturschutz, Umwelt und Geologie (HLNUG)). This hierarchical subdivision and the definitions of the petrographic terms are based on international conventions (e.g. Bates &amp; Jackson 1987, Gillespie &amp; Styles 1999, Robertson 1999, Hallsworth &amp; Knox 1999, Bas &amp; Streckeisen 1991, Schmid 1981, Fisher &amp; Smith 1991). Furthermore, the classification corresponds to the subdivision provided by existing property data compilations such as e.g. Hantschel and Kauerauf (2009), Sch\u00f6n (2011), Rybach (1984) and Clauser and Huenges (1995). Petrographic classifications from rank 1 to rank 4 can usually be identified from macroscopic descriptions of well logs, cores and geological mapping. The petrographic classifications from rank 5 to rank 9 require additional information on the texture or grain size, the modal composition or the geochemistry etc., which can usually only be acquired by microscopic or comparable special investigations. Overall, the nine ranks cover a total of 1494 petrographic terms and thus goes well beyond other standardized catalogues (e.g. 'Simplified Lithology' in GeoSciML). The petrographic classification of a sample in P\u00b3 is based on the sample description within the original literature reference. A petrographic ID and a corresponding petrographic parental ID directly correlate the different classifications and their ranks.",

        "description": "Compilation of downhole logging data from the borehole PTA2 inside Bradshaw Army Camp in the saddle region between Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa on the Big Island of Hawai'i (Composite OSG Logging Data Hawaii PTA2.asc, ASCII). The PTA2 borehole was fully cored into a lava dominated rock sequence; open hole bit size was HQ. The data were derived from the following logging runs in February and June 2016: GR total natural Gamma ray, SGR spectrum natural Gamma ray, MS magnetic susceptibility, BS borehole sonic, DIP dipmeter, and ABI43 acoustic borehole imager. All sondes were run in an open hole section below the casing shoe: 885 - 1566 m except for the SGR, which was also measured in the cased upper section and the ABI43, which also logged a 40 m long section inside the casing. The logging data are complemented by Acoustic borehole image data that were measured in June 2016 in the open hole section below the casing shoe: 889 - 1566 m; open hole bit size was HQ. Logging sonde: ABI43 (ALT). The images are oriented to north (magnetic orientation). File formats are DLIS and WCL (WellCAD 5.2). The data are further described in Jerram et al. (2019, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5194\/sd-25-15-2019). The logging data was measured and processed by the Operational Support Group (OSG) of ICDP hosted by GFZ Potsdam (see https:\/\/www.icdp-online.org\/support\/service\/downhole-logging\/?type=12&amp;tx_icdpdatatables_pi1%5Bajaxcall%5D=1 for further information).

        "description": "Temperature changes and variations in pore fluid salinity may negatively affect the permeability of clay\u2010bearing sandstones with implications for natural fluid flow and geotechnical applications alike. Cheng and Milsch (2020) investigated these factors for a sandstone dominated by illite as the clay phase. Flechtinger sandstone, a Lower Permian (Upper Rotliegend) sedimentary rock outcropping and commercially mined at the Sventesius Quarry near Flechtingen, Germany, was selected for the experiments. Three cylindrical cores were drilled from a larger block. Subsequently, samples were prepared with polished and plane-parallel end faces having a diameter of 30 mm and a length of 40 mm. The three samples were labelled FS1, FS3, and FS4, respectively. The three samples were vacuum-dried in an oven at 60 \u00b0C for 24 hours. They were then set under vacuum in a desiccator chamber for 10 hours and saturated with deionized water for another 24 hours. All experiments were performed with two flow-through apparatuses with details described in Milsch et al. (2008). The saturated sample is jacketed with a Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP) heat shrink tubing and is then mounted in the vessel. Afterwards, the two sample ends are connected to the upstream and downstream pumps, respectively. The flow direction, generally, is from the bottom to the top side of the sample but can be reversed for return permeability measurements.",

This thermometry method exploits that the degree of graphitization of carbonateous matter (CM), which is measured via Raman spectroscopy, increases with metamorphic temperature. This dataset provides the raw data of RSCM, spectrum fitting results and calculated peak temperatures of more than 100 samples from the central Tauern Window. We used this data to constrain the distribution of metamorphic peak temperatures in this area. Raman analysis was performed on polished thin and thick sections. We exclusively measured grains of CM that were enclosed in translucent minerals (quartz, white mica, chlorite, carbonates, chloritoid, garnet) and therefore not exposed on the section surface, in order to avoid destruction of the CM during the sample preparation process. Raman spectra were acquired in the first-order region of graphite (ca. 1000-1900 cm^-1). Further details on the analytical setup, spectrum fitting and temperature calculation are provided in the following sections. The data is distributed in the form of simple text files and raster images.",

Sedimentological, clay mineralogical and geochemical investigations were carried out on the core interval between 90 and 124 m depth, corresponding to ca. 2.4\u20133.4 Ma. The aim was to reconstruct the climatic and tectonic history of the continental region during the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation in Late Pliocene time. A major climate change occurred in the Lake Baikal area at about 2.65 Ma. Enhanced physical weathering in the catchment, mirrored in the illite to smectite ratio, and temporarily reduced bioproduction in the lake, reflected by the diatom abundance, evidence a change towards a colder and more arid climate, probably associated with an intensification of the Siberian High.",

We suggest that faecal pellets could be a suitable microenvironment for sulphate reduction. And while greigite could potentially act as proxy for faecal pellets in glacial sediments, unfortunately, we cannot rely on this possible indicator since the greigite is very sensitive to onshore alterations after sampling (Snowball and Thompson, 1990).",

They attributed these pyrite-rich levels to mineralization at sediment\/water interface under anoxic bottom water conditions. However, we prefer to interpret the greigite as a result of magnetite transformation when sulphate reduction occurs in the interglacial sediments. Peak sulphur contents would therefore be due to sulphur mineralization within the sediment and would not result from an enrichment of the sediment in sulphur at the sediment\/water interface.",

Titanium content is a good reflection of detrital input since minerals containing titanium are not very sensitive to dissolution. Iron, however, is rather mobile and involved in the redox history of highly porous sediments: the spike of iron observed on top of the sedimentary column (Fig. 9A) marks the redox front. We observed a strong similarity between the titanium and HIRM curves: the detrital input decreases from the late glacial to the Holocene. In ancient sediments, HIRM and titanium display similar variations with high values in glacials and low values in interglacials (Fig. 9B).",

The neighbouring site was chosen for comparison because although the quality of the ODP Site 984 paleomagnetic record is high, its \u03b418O records are of lower quality than those of ODP Site 983. Synchronous paleomagnetic variations observed in ODP Sites 983 and 984 sediments (Fig. 10) show that the premise of our age model based on paleomagnetic correlation is identical, if the reference curve used for correlation is from ODP Site 983. We can, therefore, compare climatic records from ODP site 983 and Lake Baikal.

        "description": "Investigation of the sedimentary record of pre-Alpine Lake Mondsee (Upper Austria) focused on the environmental reaction to rapid Lateglacial climatic changes. Results of this study reveal complex proxy responses that are variable in time and influenced by the long-term evolution of the lake and its catchment. A new field sampling approach facilitated continuous and precisely controlled parallel sampling at decadal to sub-annual resolution for m-XRF element scanning, carbon geochemistry, stable isotope measurements on ostracods, pollen analyses and large-scale thin sections for microfacies analysis. The Holocene chronology is established through microscopic varve counting and supported by accelerator mass spectrometric 14C dating of terrestrial plant macrofossils, whereas the Lateglacial age model is based on d18O wiggle matching with the Greenland NGRIP record, using the GICC05 chronology. Microfacies analysis enables the detection of subtle sedimentological changes, proving that depositional processes even in rather large lake systems are highly sensitive to climate forcing. Comparing periods of major warming at the onset of the Lateglacial and Holocene and of major cooling at the onset of the Younger Dryas reveals differences in proxy responses, reflecting threshold effects and ecosystem inertia. Temperature increase, vegetation recovery, decrease of detrital flux and intensification of biochemical calcite precipitation at the onset of the Holocene took place with only decadal leads and lags over a ca. 100 a period, whereas the spread of woodlands and the reduction of detrital flux lagged the warming at the onset of the Lateglacial Interstadial by ca. 500-750 a. Cooling at the onset of the Younger Dryas is reflected by the simultaneous reaction of d18O and vegetation, but sedimentological changes (reduction of endogenic calcite content, increase in detrital flux) were delayed by about 150-300 a. Three short-term Lateglacial cold intervals, corresponding to Greenland isotope substages GI-1d, GI-1c2 and GI-1b, also show complex proxy responses that vary in time.",

        "description": "In eastern Hesse and western Thuringia, Germany hosts significant potassium-bearing salt deposits industrially excavated in the Werra-Fulda mining district. The salt belongs to the upper Permian (Zechstein) and was deposited around 258 to 252.5 Ma ago. In the Werra-Fulda mining district, the halite rocks (Werra-Rocksalt, z1NA) contain two minable potash seams, potash Seam Th\u00fcringen (z1KTh) and potash Seam Hessen (z1KHe), with an average thickness between 2 m and 3 m (Figure 1). To investigate the chemical and isotopic composition of the gas phase of Seam Hessen, gaseous samples were collected from five, 2-meter deep, horizontal boreholes drilled in the potash horizon which is mined at a depth of 540 m. About 4 weeks in advance of the gas sampling, the packer-closed boreholes were evacuated to about 3kPa and the pressure gradient inside the holes was continuously monitored in the boreholes D1 to D5. Selected gas samples were analyzed for their noble gas isotopic composition and the \u03b413C values of CO2 and CH4. The noble gas isotopic compositions were determined using a VG 5400 noble gas mass spectrometer after purification in a preparation line. The carbon isotope compositions were analysed with a GC-IRMS, comprising a GC 6890N connected to a GC-C\/TC III combustion device and coupled to a MAT 253 mass spectrometer. The standard deviation of the \u03b413C values (in \u2030 vs. VPDB) is \u00b1 0.5 \u2030. The data are provided as one, Excel file with three spreadsheets as well as three individual, tab-delimited text files.",

        "description": "Silicon is a beneficial element for many plants, and is deposited in plant tissue as amorphous bio-opal (phytoliths). The biochemical processes of uptake and precipitation induce isotope fractionation: the mass-dependent shift in the relative abundances of the stable isotopes of silicon. At the bulk scale, the silicon isotope composition reported as \u03b430Si span from -2 to +6 \u2030. To further constrain these variations, at the scale of individual phytolith fragments we applied in situ femtosecond laser ablation multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (fsLA-MC-ICP-MS) to a set of 7 natural phytolith samples.\n      Two phytoliths samples (Norway spruce Picea abies and European beech Fagus sylvatica L.) were extracted from the organic-rich topsoil horizon (O) of two studies sites in Germany (Beerenbusch, close to village Rheinsberg and Wildmooswald, in the southern Black Forest). The other five phytolith samples (bushgrass Calamagrostis epigejos, common reed Phragmites australis, common horsetail Equisetum arvense, annual and perennial rough horsetail Equisetum hyemale) were separated from plant materials.\n      The individual phytolith fragments were analysed by fsLA-MC-ICP-MS and Si isotope results are reported in the \u03b4-notation (delta) as permil deviation relative to NIST SRM610, which is isotopically indistinguishable from the reference material NBS28 (quartz NIST SRM8546 alias NBS28, \u03b429Si \u2261 0 and \u03b430Si \u2261 0). Raw data processing and background corrections were made according to the protocol described in Schuessler and von Blanckenburg (2014) that also involves application of several data rejection\/acceptance criteria. Of these, the most important ones are that A) only 30\/28Si and 29\/28Si ratios are used for the calculation which deviate less than 3 standard deviation from the mean and B) only results which follow the mass-depended terrestrial fractionation line in a three-isotope-plot of \u03b429Si vs. \u03b430Si within analytical uncertainties and C) have a mass bias drift between the two bracketing standards of less than 0.30 \u2030 in 30\/28Si are accepted and reported in this study.\n      Detailed description of the sample origin, preparation steps, and the measurement protocol can be found in Frick, D.

        "description": "The database presented here contains radiogenic neodymium and strontium isotope ratios measured on both terrestrial and marine sediments. It was compiled to help assessing sediment provenance and transport processes for various time intervals. This can be achieved by either mapping sediment isotopic signature and\/or fingerprinting source areas using statistical tools (see supplemental references).\n      The database has been built by incorporating data from the literature and the SedDB database and harmonizing the metadata, especially units and geographical coordinates. The original data were processed in three steps. Firstly, a specific attention has been devoted to provide geographical coordinates to each sample in order to be able to map the data. When available, the original geographical coordinates from the reference (generally DMS coordinates, with different precision standard) were transferred into the decimal degrees system. When coordinates were not provided, an approximate location was derived from available information in the original publication. Secondly, all samples were assigned a set of standardized criteria that help splitting the dataset in specific categories. We defined categories associated with the sample location (\"Region\", \"Sub-region\", \"Location\", which relate to location at continental to city\/river scale) or with the sample types (terrestrial samples \u2013 \u201caerosols\u201d, \u201csoil sediments\u201d, \u201criver sediments\u201d - or marine samples \u2013\u201cmarine sediment\u201d or \u201ctrap sample\u201d). Thirdly, samples were discriminated according to their deposition age, which allowed to compute average values for specific time intervals (see attached table \"Age_determination_Sediment_Cores.csv\"). The dataset will be updated bi-annually and might be extended to reach a global geographical extent and\/or add other type of samples.\n      This dataset contains two csv tables: \"Dataset_Nd_Sr_isotopes.csv\" and \"Age_determination_Sediment_Cores.csv\". \"Dataset_Nd_Sr_isotopes.csv\" contains the assembled dataset of marine and terrestrial Nd and\/or Sr concentration and isotopes, together with sorting criteria and geographical locations. \"Age_determination_Sediment_Cores.csv\" contains all background information concerning the determination of the isotopic signature of specific time intervals (depth interval, number of samples, mean and standard deviation). Column headers are explained in respective metadata comma-separated files. A human readable data description is provided in portable document format, as well.

        "description": "The International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) performed a dual-phase scientific drilling project to investigate mountain-building processes called Collisional Orogeny in the Scandinavian Caledonides (COSC). The borehole COSC-1 was drilled through the Lower Seve Nappe, as the first of two 2.5 km deep drill holes close to \u00c5re, central Sweden. The recovered rocks comprise a 1650 m thick suite of high grade gneisses and amphibolites with clear Seve Nappe affinities, while the lower 850 m comprise rather homogenous mylonitic gneisses with interfingered K-rich phyllonite bands of cm to several m size and some intercalated amphibolites. The different lithologies all crosscut the core in a subhorizontal direction with foliation of gneisses and phyllonites in the same direction. Albite and garnet porphyroblasts with pressure shadows show syn-deformational growth and the same sub-horizontal alignment. The focus of this study was to detect chemical and mineralogical differences in mylonitic and host rocks and to relate these differences to either metasomatism and deformation or inherited source rock variance. Another goal of this work is to compare chemical core scanning instruments. For this purpose two different X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) techniques, Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) and hyperspectral imaging served to measure seven samples from the lower 850 m of the COSC-1 core. This data publication comprises the datasets gained in the course of this study. The metadata (OF WHAT?) will be presented in an additional file including XRF data from the Avaatech XRF core scanner in a txt.file as well as datasets of the other used devices in original file formats.",

        "description": "As reverse weathering has been shown to impact long-term changes in atmospheric CO2 levels, it is crucial to develop quantitative tools to reconstruct marine authigenic clay formation. We explored the potential of the beryllium (Be) isotope ratio (10Be\/9Be) recorded in marine clay-sized sediment to track neoformation of authigenic clays. The power of such proxy relies on the orders-of-magnitude difference in 10Be\/9Be ratios between continental Be and Be dissolved in seawater. On riverine and marine sediments collected along a Chilean margin transect we chemically extracted reactive phases and separated the clay-sized sediment fraction. We compare the riverine and marine 10Be\/9Be ratio of this fraction. Moreover, we compare the elemental and mineralogical composition and the Nd and Sr-isotopic composition of these samples. 10Be\/9Be ratios increase four-fold from riverine to marine sediment. We attribute this increase to the incorporation of Be high in 10Be\/9Be from dissolved biogenic opal, which also serves as a Si-source for the precipitation of marine authigenic clays. 10Be\/9Be ratios thus sensitively track reverse-weathering reactions forming marine authigenic clays.",

        "description": "The Central Rift in Kenya (CRK) comprises the lakes Naivasha, Elementaita and Nakuru and the Longonot, Eburru and Menengai volcanos. The alkaline magmas, produced by the volcanoes within the CRK, lead to solid rocks likes trachytes, phonolites, and fewer basalts and accompanied soft rocks like ashes, tuffs, pumices and ignimbrites (e.g. Macdonald et al., 1987; Macdonald, 2014). Lacustrine sediments and beds of diatoms are remnants of former lake level variations caused by climate variability and topographic changes (e.g. Stoof-Leichsenring et al., 2011). The samples have been taken within the frame of a VW-Foundation funded project that tries to detect, map and monitor groundwater pollution from anthropogenic and natural sources. For a previous VW-Foundation funded project (grant 85465), also the groundwater fluoride enrichment in the CRK have been studied (Olaka et al., 2016). This data report presents the metadata, inclusive GPS data from 52 solid volcanic rock and sediment samples taken during a field excursion during May 2017. A geological map with all data locations is included in this report. After sample preparation, we performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses to get the mineral content and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) as well as Ion-Chromatographic (IC) analyses to get the elemental concentration of those samples. The results are given together with analytical limitations and few additional information despite a graphic visualization of the XRD-data. The data are presented in tab-delimited text format and described in the dataset description.",

        "description": "The project from which the data derived aimed to establish the first systematic study of Cu isotope fractionation during the prehistoric smelting and refining process. For this reason, an experimental approach was used to smelt sulfide copper ore according to reconstructed prehistoric smelting models. The ore was collected by E. Hanning as part of her PhD thesis work from a Bronze Age mining site, the Mitterberg region, Austria (Hanning and Pils 2011) and was made available for the experiments. All starting materials for the experiments such as the natural ore, roasted ore, construction clay, flux, dung (used for the roasting), wood and charcoal (fuel) were natural materials. All firing conditions including the amount of fuel or charging material and the temperatures in the furnaces were recorded, and the experimental procedures were documented in the very detail. In total, 30 experiments were carried out in 4 experimental series. The smelting products, both intermediate products and final products were sampled during or after the respective experiment. Slag, matte and copper metal were the major smelting products. All other materials used in and produced by the experiments were sampled, too. Materials used and produced in the two most promising experimental series with regard to potential Cu isotope fractionation were analyzed. Based on the analytical results, the potential of Cu isotopes as a tool in archaeometallurgical research was systematically evaluated and consequences for the copper isotope application as a provenance tool in archaeometry were identified. The data include the documentation of the experiments, laboratory procedures and analytical methods. An experimental outline was previously published in Rose et al. (2019). Analytical methods applied were ICP-MS (elemental analysis, 80 samples), MC-ICP-MS (copper isotopes, 98 samples), and XRD (phase analysis, 25 samples). The experiments were carried out at the R\u00f6misch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum, Labor f\u00fcr Experimentelle Arch\u00e4ologie, Mayen, Germany. Laboratories used for the analytical part of the project were the research laboratories at the Deutsches Bergbau-Museum Bochum and FIERCE (Frankfurt Isotope and Element Research Center), Goethe-University Frankfurt, both Germany. Data were processed and plots created with R (R Core Team 2019) in RStudio\u00ae. Data are provided as data tables or text files, the R scripts used to create the time-temperature plots of the smelting experiments are also included.

        "description": "This data publication contains scanning electron microscope (SEM) and (scanning) transmission electron microscope ((S)TEM) images as well as electron energy loss spectra (EELS) and Raman spectra of the principal slip surface of carbonate fault mirrors. We analysed a total of eleven samples to investigate the formation mechanisms of fault mirrors in carbonates. The samples were taken as drill cores in Central Greece from two different outcrop locations. The first location, close to Arkitsa, is a large anthropogenic outcrop exposing three large fault planes. The second location is close to Schinos and was also formed by human interaction at the side of a gravel road. The data set contains supplemental material to the publication \"Mechanisms of fault mirror formation and fault healing in carbonate rocks\" by Ohl et al., (2020). In addition to the electron microscopy images we provide the spectra files of the Raman and EELS measurements for the identification of the carbon species in relation to the principal slip surface. The publication concludes that decarbonation of calcite during fault slip and the subsequent reaction of the decarbonation products produces fault mirror surfaces. Post-seismic hybridization of carbon results in partly-hybridised amorphous carbon and contributes to connecting hanging wall and footwall. In addition, post-seismic carbonation of portlandite produces secondary nano-sized calcite crystals &lt; 50 nm facilitating fault healing.",

        "title": "Decollement depth of Active thrust faults in Italy",
        "description": "Based on available geological and geophysical data, the depth of the basal thrust decollement for compressional areas of Italy is collected. The proposed dataset is useful to a large scientific and risk-management audience (e.g., input for numerical modelling of regional studies, or providing the maximum depth of brittle crust useful to constraints maximum expected magnitudes for the study region). The dataset is presented as a long table (2019-028_Petricca_Table1.txt) in tab-separated text format. The table contains three columns indicating 1) the longitude, 2) the latitude and 3) the depth (in km) values of the maximum thrust faulting depth. Obtained depths range between 1 and 17 km. Conceptual model for the definition of the active thrust decollement depths (see Petricca et al., 2019): to define the basal decollement depth of active thrust faults are selected 75 published geological and seismic sections plus two maps of basal decollement (Table 1 in Petricca et al., 2019 for references). The study domain is gridded with nodes every 10x10 km. At each node coinciding with a seismic or geological section, the punctual value of the basal decollement depth with respect to the sea level is assigned. For the Calabrian Arc and part of Sicily, we used values picked from depth maps. Depth values at empty nodes are assigned by interpolation criteria using the minimum curvature method (Briggs, 1974), generalized by Smith and Wessel (1990) including the tension factor (i.e., the smoothing grade - 0.5 in this case). Further, the trend of the obtained isodepth contours is recalibrated following the composite sources (i.e. the maximum depth of seismogenic sources given in the DISS database - see Basili et al., 2008). Depth correction is obtained adding\/subtracting the topography\/bathymetry elevation\/depth at nodes using values interpolated from ETOPO1 Global Relief Model. Due to the fact that the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) depth is possibly and locally shallower than the basal thrust depth (zbt), further correction is necessary. For this purpose, the BDT depths from Petricca et al. (2015) is compared with the basal thrust depths zbt from this study to select at each node of the computation grid the shallower value. The majority of the studied areas show a basal thrust depth (zmax) shallower than the BDT. An exception occurs offshore in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea, Sicily, where the BDT depth (10-12 km) is considerably shallower than the basal thrust depth (zmax&lt;30 km). Limited portions of the northern Apennines and the part of the Calabrian arc close to the coast show comparable depths between the basal thrust (zmax) and BDT (i.e., 14-17 km).",

        "description": "This data publication uses XRD bulk rock analyses carried out on cuttings aboard D\/V Chikyu during the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expeditions 338 and 348 of the Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) project (Strasser et al, 2014, Tobin et al., 2015). More data on clay minerals in the C0002F and C0002P holes are published by Underwood and Song (2016a and 2016b), and Underwood (2017). These data are supplementary material for Schleicher and Jurado (2019). XRD data of the clay size fraction were analyzed at the University of Michigan, USA, and the GFZ Potsdam, Germany. All XRD analyses of the random powder and texture (oriented) preparation followed the analytical methods described in Moore and Reynolds (1997). Oriented clay size samples were measured under air-dried and glycolated conditions, the latter treatment caused interlayer expansion of swelling clays, allowing the recognition of discrete smectite and mixed-layer smectitic phases. In order to compare the clay mineral content, and the mineral amount relative to the adjacent material, exactly 45 \u03bcg of the material was mixed with 1.5 ml deionized water and dropped on a round glass slide (diameter 32 mm). All air-dried samples were measured at a relative humidity (RH) of ~30%, and afterward stored in a desiccator filled with ethylene glycol, in order to investigate the final swelling stage of the smectitic phases. The data are provided as tab delimited table (2019-002_Schleicher-Jurado_XRD-data.txt, see also Table 1 in Schleicher and Jurado, 2019) with the following columns:- Hole: name of the C0002 subhole- Depth (mbsf): depth in meter below surface (mbsf)- Sample (SMW): sample number SMW (solid cuttings taken from drilling mud)- Smectite (int.\/cps): intensity of smectite in counts per second (cps)- Illite (int.\/cps): intensity of smectite in counts per second (cps) In addition, the original XRD measurements are provided in raw and text formats (2019-002_Schleicher-Jurado_original-XRD-measurements.zip).

        "description": "This data set contains mineral chemical analyses of chromite, orthopyroxene and plagioclase of five chromitite layers and their immediate host rocks from drill core ZK135 of the northwestern Bushveld Complex. The sampled interval of ZK135 covers the transition of the Lower and Middle Group chromitites (LG6, LG6a, MG1, MG2, MG2 II). Detailed geochemical profiles are presented by data sheets and graphically to reveal small-scale variations in mineral chemistry.\n      Mineral chemical analyses were conducted on drill core material from borehole ZK135 from the Thaba mine, operated by Cronimet Chrome Mining SA (Pty) Ltd. Briefly, each layer is hosted in pyroxenite and comprises a main chromitite layer and in some chromitites additional stringers above or below the main layer. Chromitites are composed of chromite, which are cemented by intercumulus plagioclase and orthopyroxene oikocrysts. A detailed study of the orthopyroxene oikocrysts in MG1 was published by Kaufmann et al. (2018). Additionally, euhedral to subhedral cumulus orthopyroxene is present in the LG6a, MG1 and MG2 layers. Pyroxenitic partings, small layers of pyroxenite within the chromitite, occur throughout the LG6 to MG2 layers. The main mineral phases chromite, orthopyroxene and plagioclase were analyzed by electron microprobe in each layer and the adjacent pyroxenitic host rocks.\n      Major-element compositions of chromite, orthopyroxene and plagioclase were analyzed by electron microprobe at the Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde Berlin with a JEOL JXA-8500F EMP equipped with a field emission cathode and five wavelength-dispersive spectrometers.

The method is based on the comparison of the diffraction spectrum of the unknown sample with those of pure minerals. The powder diffraction data of the minerals are stored in a database built up of 250 natural minerals separated from various types of igneous and metamorphic rocks. The complete analyses (radiation: Cu K alpha, lambda: 1,5405\u00c5, stepwidth: 0,01\u00b0, counting time 2 sec\/step, angle 2-80\u00b0) was carried out automatically including computations. The results of this quantitative phase analysis were used e.g. to check thin section petrography (and vice versa) and to construct a \\\"mineralogical rock composition log\\\".",
